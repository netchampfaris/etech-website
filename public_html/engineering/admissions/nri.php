      <h4>NOTE:</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important to note that if your parents work in the gulf countries then you can apply for this special case of NRI quota. But it is also required to note that all colleges that have NRI quota do not necessarily have the special case of NRI quota. Always check with the college regarding this while you are applying for your admission. Also, if you are a special case of NRI quota then you are allowed to apply for the General NRI quota as well. But this will narrow your chances of entering into that particular college because the no. of students in the general NRI category are higher.</p>
