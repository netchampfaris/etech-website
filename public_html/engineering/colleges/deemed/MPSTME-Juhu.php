					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">NMIMS Mukesh Patel’s School of Technology Management and Engineering (MPSTME), Juhu</h2>
					<hr>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4f8335;"><em><strong>Note: MPSTME is under NMIMS Deemed University and follows a separate entrance exam &amp; admission procedure, details of which can be found <a href="/engineering-admissions?id=449">here</a>.</strong></em></span></p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any other SVKM institute, Mukesh Patel’s School of Technology Management and Engineering is located in Juhu. It’s a stone’s throw away from Irla - the very famous Alfa lane. It’s a 10 minute rickshaw ride from Vile Parle station (W.Rly. &amp; Harbour Rly.). Best landmarks for MPSTME is Cooper Hospital and Amar Juice Centre.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure of NMIMS Mukesh Patel School of Technology, Management and Engineering is really niche above the rest. Recently constructed building adds to its fresh looks. Amazing classrooms with ultra modern facilities &nbsp;are the highlights of this college. Entertainment rooms equipped with a high end table tennis table, a carom board and a relaxing zone. Highly informative library is one more of the college’s various goodies. Great place for a 2 night 3 day stay (Haha! But it's true).&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Thankfully, the college has hostel facilities which are equally top notch. Since the college has over whelming response from all over the country, the hostel service is definitely a blessing in disguise for the non Mumbaikars.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">MPSTME charges a whopping Rs. 2,30,000/year for its B.Tech course and Rs. 2,65,000 per year for MBA Tech.&nbsp;</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The management quota fee is generally Rs. 3,40,000 per year.</span></li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Hostel charges are around Rs. 1,00,000 per annum.</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">You can expect decent faculty at MPSTME. The pendulum of it sweeps a path from one of the worse to one of the finest! In the end, it's Mother Luck that decides which period of oscillation you experience. Students claim that Civil Engg. department teachers are very stubborn and loaded with attitude. Contrary to that, other departments have got a <em>chalta hai</em> attitude towards the teaching staff.&nbsp;The college has made some good improvement over the last two years as far as faculty is concerned. Some PhD holders while some just M.Tech/B.Tech passouts makes &nbsp;it a striking blend of faculty at MPSTME. The teaching is good and can be relied upon.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is a bit strict at NMIMS Mukesh Patel School of Technology, Management and Engineering. They demand a compulsory 80% attendance. Usually those below 75% but above 60% get penalties in the form of assignments and there have been cases of strict action against students of very low attendance. Many students have got a trim (trimester pattern) back and have to repeat the semester or give the exam duirng vacations. So, it is advisable to keep attendance above 65% at least. For the labs, it follows the ‘100% attendance’ policy.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">MPSTME is the meeting place of various people traversing vertically from the north and the south of our country and of course, <em>Aamchi</em> Mumbai as well. Good cultural blend with lots to learn and share. It’s the marriage of the localites and the hostelites in their common language.&nbsp;Good fun loving life. Not completely focussed on academics, one has time to pursue his/her own interests. One may tend to get attached to it pretty seriously. Oh, and the crowd is certainly one of the best in town - the fee says it all. It is majorly dominated by students from high class backgrounds followed by some from the upper middle class.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NMIMS Mukesh Patel School of Technology, Management and Engineering has an excellent canteen which caters &nbsp;to the needs of all the taste buds. From Pav Bhaji to South Indian, <em>Chaat</em> to Chocolcate Milk Shakes, Lunch Plate to Chinese, Rolls to Parathas and mouthwatering <em>lassis</em>, lime water, cadburys and candies - &nbsp;the canteen has it all (still not satisfied? Go die!). And the best part is that the prices are dirt cheap while the quality is five star. Extremely spacious. Most of the students have their meals in the canteen followed by students of neighbouring SVKM insitutes who are seen in huge numbers. Parathas and a variety of juices are renowned. Great options among desserts are also available.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">MPSTME has another canteen on the 8th floor of the building which serves more or less the same quality and quantity and hosts around 80 to 100 people at a time.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">On Campus: Canteen and they also have excellent boys' lounge and girls' lounge.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Off Campus: <em>Paan Tapri </em>(Smoke lovers) at the corner of the road, Amar Juice Centre,&nbsp; Pappilon, DJ Canteen (for those who didn't know, D.J. Sanghvi is a couple of steps away), Malls (Fun Republic, Citi Mall, Infinity Mall), Lokhandwala and Juhu beach is always there. Other eat-outs include Pizza Hut, Crepe station, Garcia’s, Subway, McDonald’s, ShivSagar, Naturals (The ice-cream of Juhu scheme).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Various Festivals held by different management firms at Mukesh Patel</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Annual Cultural fest being “Sattva” and the Technical one named “Taquneeq”. Students are pretty excited during the festivals and the mood is extremely jovial and heart thumping.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost 100% placements are recorded every year. Companies like Infosys, Accenture, Patni, Tech Mahindra, HCL, Tawant Software, Capital IQ etc. (just to name a few) recruited from MPSTME. The placements for MBA Tech are getting better each year and they might surpass even that of B.Tech in coming years. Students also get internship offers in their penultimate year. Average salaries are around 3.5 lakh per annum while highest goes up to 4.5 - 5 LPA.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Special Note:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Admissions are undertaken based on the scores of a separate exam called NMAT followed by an interview. The institute is not under the Mumbai University, it is affiliated to the deemed NMIMS University and students are hence awarded B.Tech. degree. Also the earlier trimester pattern is abandoned for the usual semester system.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It also offers 5-year MBA tech. courses in Information Technology (30 seats), Electronics &amp; Telecommunication (40 seats), Chemical (30 seats) , Civil (30 seats) and Mechanical (40 seats). It is a flagship course of this college, the first to be started in India and was followed by BITS Pilani. The 5 years are divided as 3 years technical, 1 trimester internship and 2 years MBA. All students have internships and a minimum of 4 projects in their curriculum. 100% placements have been recorded with the highest package offered being around Rs. 8 lac/annum.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NMIMS's Mukesh Patel is a brilliant college to go to if you want to enjoy a royal life. It’s a rare combination of studies, crowd and life but the fees are exorbitantly high which is a huge minus for many middle class families. Meeting people from diversified background is one of the strongest points of this college.</p>	</section>
