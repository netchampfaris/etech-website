					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">NMIMS' Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management &amp; Engineering (MPSTME) - Shirpur Campus</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The famous NMIMS' Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management &amp; Engineering (MPSTME) located in Vile Parle has its another campus located 370km far from Mumbai near a small town called Shirpur in north Maharashtra. Shirpur is a small town of the size of Kandivali (or any other of bombay's smaller suburbs). The college campus is off the Mumbai - Agra highway, 8km shy of Shirpur. Nearest Railway Station - Dhule is about 53km from the campus, where you get ST bus or cabs for college. There are direct buses by private operators from Mumbai as well.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Campus is huge and is termed as Mukesh Patel Technology Park. It is a complete residential program so all the students are required to stay on campus. It boasts of one of the best infrastructure seen in any college all over India.&nbsp;It is equipped with all modern amenities - separate boys' and girls' hostels, gymnasium, gymkhana, swimming pool, indoor sports, volleyball court, tennis court, a huge cricket ground and what not. The campus is lush green and looks very&nbsp;pleasing to the eyes. The interiors are done in a fashion similar to all SVKM instituions. It looks all trendy, glossy and chic. For interner there are Wi-fi hot spots all over the campus and additionally a high speed intranet is also there.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Hostels are pretty good. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. There are facilities like internet, newspapers and TV room. Opting for mess is also compulsory. Studetns generally do not like the food in here in spite of changing many caterers. They have brought in the famous Aditi Fast food (those staying in Andheri-Parle belt would know it) some time back &nbsp;which has suffiecinetly reduced the complaints. They are the same people responsible for wonderful food at MPSTME - Mumbai campus as well. And yes there is an option of Jain food as well.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">B.Tech - Rs 1,25,000 per annum;&nbsp;MBA Tech - Rs 2,00,000</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Hostel - Non-AC: Rs 50,000 a year; Air-Conditioned - Rs 1,00,000 per year.</li>

					</ul>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Except a select few don't expect any decent professor imparting knowledge. Many guest lecturers from DJ Sanghvi used to visit initially and they were liked by students but there has been a decline in the number of guest lectures. MBA Tech students have provision to shift to Mumbai post 3rd year.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is very strict compared to MPSTME Mumbai campus. There are cases of Trimester back due to poor attendance. The rules are followed without a single exception.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">People come from all the regions of the country except South India come down to Shirpur. Crowd from Mumbai, Gujarat and North generally forms majority. Students are from well to do backgrounds. They are friendly and enthusiastic. And the campus seems to be buzzing with activity all the time. Rumours have it that mild ragging is also there over here. Also one needs to beware and not fall prey to bad habits or addiciton due to peer pressure.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">You'll get bored by the canteen food in a matter of a week or two.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">No hangouts at all. It's surrounded by villages. Moreover, you are not allowed to leave the campus as per your free will.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festival:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Ambiora (technical) and Protsahan (cultural) are the college festivals of MPSTME Shirpur campus. Other than these, various religious festival like Ganapati, Navratri and Lohri are celebrated every year as a part of student initiatve. College also provides good support in conducting them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Placements at NMIMS Shirpur campus are pretty good. Students who manage to maintain decent acads (60% and above) and represent themselves well in the interviews (i.e can speak English) definitely get a job. Average package is around 3 Lakh per annum and 90% of the eligible candidates get placed. Standard mass recruiting IT companies like Accenture, Tech Mahindra and Infosys are seen here.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p>Great infrastructure and a unique feel of hostel life which you get only in a residential program are the USPs of Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management &amp; Engineering (MPSTME) Shirpur Campus. It is better than tier 2 and tier 3 colleges of Mumbai in many aspects. But the only question you need to ask yourself (and your parents) that is the return-on-investment worth the investment i.e 8 or 10 Lakh.</p>	</section>
