					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">SNDT University's Usha Mittal Institute of Technology (UMIT), Santacruz</h2>
					<hr>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4f8335;"><em><strong>Note: Usha Mittal Institute of Technology (UMIT) is affiliated to SNDT Women's University (<a title="Read more about Deemed Universities &amp; Autonomous Colleges" href="/engineering-admissions?id=1270" target="_blank">Deemed University</a>) but admissions are conducted under CAP.</strong></em></span></p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">SNDT University's Usha Mittal College of Engineering is located at a 15 minute walk from Santacruz (west) railway station (western &amp; harbour railway). You can also take BEST bus number 231 (which is pretty frequent). Share rickshaws are also available from station.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the first building as you enter the very famous and pretty huge SNDT campus. In the 6-storeyed building of Usha Mittal Institute of Technology (UMIT), the first 4 floors house the UMIT College of engineering and top 2 floors are for students pursuing post graduation. The building is in the process of being painted and beautified from outside. As you enter the college, you find a vast foyer which is well maintained and gives a better impression of the college as compared to its first look from the outside. Class rooms and labs are spacious and airy, and the building is well maintained. Each classroom has an LCD projector and labs too have all the equipment some of which aren't updated. There is a badminton court which is very popular.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.Tech - Rs- 99468/- a year.&nbsp;Changes every year though.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.Tech - Rs- 126180/-year.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers at UMIT are good, more or less. If you attend the lectures regularly then there is no need of extra coaching. Many of them are PhD, others are pursuing it. They have thorough knowledge about their subjects. While most of them are friendly and helpful, for some ‘handle them with care’ approach is important.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is strict, especially in the first 3 years of engineering. You have to fulfill 75% of attendance before every term. A defaulters' list is put up every month and if you feature in it you'll be given question papers to solve or presentations to make. Some professors are lenient about it, though. But overall it is advisable to attend lectures.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd in general is average. There are many studious girls here. But seniors are friendly (especially the hostelites). Since it’s a girls college, parents from all over the India send their girls, who stay at the hostel along with Mumbai girls who come from all the parts of the city.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The very huge SNDT campus has lots of courses and their colleges, but has 1 common (albeit huge) canteen which is in the building next to UMIT. It offers good food at a reasonable price and is one of the hangouts for all the students of the entire SNDT campus. It’s an evergreen place which is never empty. A small consumer store in the SNDT campus also has some fast food which is liked by all. Food here includes Frankie, sandwiches, vada pav and stuff like that.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole huge campus itself is a hangout. Besides, the Juhu Beach is at a 5-7 minute walking distance from the college which is often visited by the girls. Hangouts at Juhu include the famous Shiv-Sagar hotel, Shabri, Mochas, Café Coffee Day and things similar.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">UMIT has student chapters of organizations like the IEEE, Computer Society of India (CSI) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It is well known for its festivals: the annual cultural festival, ‘ARCANE ILLUSIONS’ and the annual technical festivals ‘REZONANCE’, ‘360 DEGREE’,’ABHIVYAKTI’ organized by the CSI and IEEE student council. A national level festival TECHTORNADO is organized by the ACM’s students’ chapter every year.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Placements here are quite good. About 65% of the students manage to get placed. Salaries offered by the companies are 2.7 lakh per annum to 7-8 lakh per annum. Majority of the companies that visit here are IT cos. like Accenture, Infosys, Capgemini, J P Morgan, Thought works, etc. Microsoft has also visited once.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">SNDT Women's University,<br> Juhu-Tara Road,<br> Sir Vitthaldas Vidyavihar,<br> Santacruz (W), Mumbai – 400049.<br> Phone: (022) - 26606040, (022) - 26605183<br> Website : <a href="http://www.umit.ac.in" target="_blank">www.umit.ac.in</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A great option for the girls having scored average marks in entrance exam. With nice faculty, campus and placements, UMIT is among top choices for many. Current students are pretty much satisfied with their college.</p>	</section>
