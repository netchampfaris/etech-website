					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi (IITD)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in 1959, the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, didn’t take too long to become one of the premier colleges of the country, and perhaps the whole world. Equally famous for its campus, its excellent pedagogy and its fantastic list of dignified alumni, IIT Delhi is one of the first names that come to mind when the word ‘engineering’ is spoken.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Built in the heart of the capital city of India, IIT-D is surrounded by a number of eating and drinking places, which is one reason why you’ll almost never find people complaining about anything. The general consensus among students is ‘It’s awesome to be here’.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The IIT Delhi campus is lovely – lush green in spite of facing the at-times-intolerable Delhi heat. The library, which is fully airconditioned, is well stocked with truckloads of books that you’ve probably never and probably will never hear of. It’s only open till 8 pm though, except during exam times when they keep it open till about 12 midnight. The campus is completely WiFi enabled, or so they claim. Most laboratories are airconditioned, but classrooms and hostels don’t get such privileges.&nbsp;Sports facilities include decently sized cricket, football, hockey fields, courts for badminton &amp; squash. There are also table tennis and weightlifting facilities.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 13 hostels, each accommodating about 400 students. For some of them students are full of complaints, though – they aren’t terribly well maintained, you may be stuffed in a room with up to 3 or 4 partners, and while students say it’s fun, we’re sure it’s not exactly comfortable. There isn't any hostel curfew in any of the hostels but opposite sex isn't allowed beyond visitors room at any time of the day. There Each hostel has its own mess, most of them stay open 24 hours. And there are some joints like Amul and Lipton in insti area which too remain open at night. There is LAN internet in hostels too with 2 GB download limit per week but it stays shut during 1 to 6 AM. There is also highspeed DC++ (local intranet).</p>

												<h3>Fees:</h3>
												<p>Rs 56635 per year<br> <a href="http://stupidsid.com/misc%20files/iitfees2013-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><em>View breakup of fees, hostel/mess charges &amp; fees for SC/ST students</em></span></a></p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are full of praise for most of the professors. Every professor teaching here has a doctorate, but sometimes students find that their teaching isn’t quite as brilliant as expected. But then again, that’s probably because the bar at IIT Delhi has been set so high.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance criteria is decided by the professor and generally kept at 75%. Usually no fail grade is alloted for attendance shortage, however, one grade penalty is common.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The boy/girl ratio is terrible, but you come to expect that when you go to any IIT. There are too few girls and the ones that land up there aren’t too great either, to be honest. Fortunately, it’s Delhi, so there’s a world of beautiful women (and handsome men) to explore once you’re out. That said, the students gel very well together, and you can be sure that at IITD you’ll have times that you may not remember (courtesy the alcohol) with friends that you’ll never forget.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Ragging here is a strict no-no. Seniors are terrified of juniors, because all a junior has to do is raise a finger at a senior and he’ll be suspended. Sounds like fun, actually.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Delhi is definitely among the top 3 IITs, and it’s a generally accepted trend that students who miss out on Bombay opt for Delhi.&nbsp;Any rank between 1 and 4000 can bring you here, though the stream you get will differ depending on your rank, of course.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s one of the best technological institutes in the country, of course it’s bound to have fantastic placements! Some of the top companies in the world visit IITD, and offer higher salaries than most other engineers across India can only dream of. The average salary is about Rs.7 lac, and the highest salary offered could even be three times that, which is just frankly bonkers if you ask us.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Activities:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Delhi hosts its cultural festival in October and its technical fest 'Tryst' in March. Both the fests are conducted on a pretty huge scale, and attract participation from across the country. There are active robotics, economics, astronomy and entrepreneurial developement clubs.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess/Hangouts:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Students spend four years of their lives cursing the mess food. And you can’t really blame them, considering the food-paradise that lies just outside the campus - Safdarjung Developement Area (SDA market). There are outlets like Barista, Costa Coffee, Subway and various confectioners at SDA. PVR Priya is the nearest theatre at a 10 minutes walk.</p>

												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Famous Alumni:</h3>
												<ul>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Chetan Bhagat- writer and public figure</li>

													<li style="text-align: justify;">Vinod Khosla- founder of Sun Microsystems and venture capitalist</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Rajat Gupta- Managing Director at McKinsey&amp;Co.</li>
												</ul>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Delhi really is a special place, and it’s the students who make it so special. Intelligence, passion and energy are some great traits to have, and they seem to be pretty common in the students here. One of the top 3 institutes in the country, IIT Delhi is definitely something that should be on your mind.</p>	</section>
