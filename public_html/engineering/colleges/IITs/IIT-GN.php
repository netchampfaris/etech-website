														<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the faculty at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, are recruited after a very tough screening procedure and the recruited faculty are one of the best in their own fields.

														<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
														<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">Boy/Girl ratio is same as any other IIT. “Guys, don’t expect much”, says a disheartened boy with a fake smile. The crowd comes from across the country.

														<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
														<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, this might surprise you and could be very enticing for any IIT aspirant. IIT Gandhinagar is the only IIT where 25% of the strength got foreign internships in their second year of under graduation.

														<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Only IIT in the whole country to organize a inter college cultural festival in its year of inception. Blithchron grew to be one of the biggest cultural festivals of Gujarat.</p>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
														<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
														<p style="text-align: justify;">The mess food is decent and boasts of many cuisines. Chinese, South Indian and North Indian are mostly served.
