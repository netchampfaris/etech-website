					<h2 style="text-align: left;">Indian Institute of Technology - Kanpur (IITK)</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Established in 1959, Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur, commonly referred as IITK or IIT Kanpur, is one of the oldest IIT’s in the country. IIT Kanpur is a centrally Deemed University located in Uttar Pradesh and currently is one of the most prestigious and high ranked engineering colleges in India. Undoubtedly, it’s the IIT!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, the Indian Institute of Technology is located roughly about 40 kilometres from the main city of Kanpur. This clearly indicates that accessibility to the college is a major issue. Fortunately, staying in the hostel is mandatory and it’s located within the campus. The nearby locality lacks any happening area and students travel all the way to the main city.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the college is not centrally located around the city of Kanpur, it has got quite an urban campus. Some students refer the campus of IITK as the best amongst all the IIT’s in the country. The lecture rooms are extremely neat and clean with comfortable benches. The air conditioned classrooms are well equipped with projectors which makes lecture sessions very live. There are many recreational centres within the campus. Moreover, the campus is wifi enabled which keeps research work and socializing to the premium level.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As a mandatory norm, students getting admitted to the IIT’s have to stay in the college hostels. There are several hostels in the Kanpur campus and are located within the campus, so travelling to the colleges ain’t cumbersome. The hostel facilities are just above average with decent, non-dusty rooms and cleaned bathrooms and toilets. There is wifi connectivity within the hostel, so keeping in touch with your loved ones after college hours is simpler.</p>

												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, we’re talking about the top engineering institute in India. Undoubtedly, the reputation of the college is primarily because of its excellent teaching staff. One of the mandatory rules at IITK is that all the professors should be atleast a PhD qualified. Most of them have got their degrees from great and high ranking universities in the USA. Apart from their crazy degrees, they’ve ENOUGH industrial experience and teaching experience at many other institutions. Some are visiting faculties at other engineering colleges. IIT Kanpur’s faculty for Computer and Electronics course is excellent and students are extremely satisfied with the teaching level. Communication isn’t a problem as almost all communicate in English. Some try to get a bit friendly and talk in Hindi as well. All in all extremely chilled out and highly knowledgeable faculty at IITK.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">At IIT, you see a male dominated world. Be it any campus within the country, 99% of the students are boys. Since IIT is a dream college for an engineering student, you see an extremely varied crowd starting from far east to far west, Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Luckily, the ragging scene in all the colleges across India has reduced and so at IITK as well. Students are extremely active in their projects and submissions. Moreover, they balance their academics and extra curriculars excellently. The festivals at IIT, technical and cultural, are a huge hit and students from other cities participate as well.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT’s are one of the premium institutes for engineering in India. As mentioned before, every student dreams to get in, but a handful of them qualify. One has to take the toughest entrance exam IIT-JEE to get admitted to any IIT institutes. As Kanpur is not one of the metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi, it’s generally ranked 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> best institute in the country. You need an All India Rank (AIR) around 500-700 to get your desired stream. If you want to join the institute at the cost of comprising the stream, then a rank around 1500 will also fetch you IITK. Rankings do matter a lot for engineering colleges, but when it comes to IIT’s, it’s simply IIT!</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Roughly, there are about 250-300 odd companies that visit the Kanpur campus of Indian Institute of Technology. Huge! To name a few, Reliance, Siemens, Goldman Sachs, Mckinsey, Facebook, InfoX, Google are the standard recruiters during the placement season. Like any other engineering college, there is no mass recruitment, hence students are paid a whopping salary roughly around 8-10 lakhs per annum. Oh, forgot to mention, 100% placements.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Being the best engineering institute in India, the college is quite well known for its internships. Big MNC’s recruit students in the third year for a summer internship of 2-3 months. Almost all these internships are paid, the salary being around 25,000 to 30,000 per month.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Activities:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT is quite famous for the numerous festivals that are conducted round the year. There are various hostel events and games that are played on regular basis. Apart from the zillion national level competitions, there are two main festivals conducted round the year.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">'Anataragini', the cultural festival, is held in the month of October while 'Techkriti', annual festival, takes place in early February.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen at IITK serves just about an average food with a very low cost. The canteen is decently spacious. Though the variations in the food items are pretty less, students are quite satisfied. Mess food is like any other hostel mess. Most of the times cold, not very tasty and less delicious items, yet students claim that the food is pretty edible.</p>
