					<h2 style="text-align: left;">Indian Institute of Technology - Guwahati (IITG)</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The Indian Institute of Technology at Guwahati, generally referred as IITG, is an autonomous engineering and technology oriented institute. It was the sixth IIT in the country and the first in the state of Assam. Established in 1995, IIT Guwahati is currently almost at par with IIT Bombay and Delhi and is considered as an excellent engineering institute in India.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Guwahati is located on the north bank of river Brahmaputra and is roughly 20 kilometres from the main city. Since, the college is not centrally located around the city, the campus is quite in a rural area of Guwahati. Accessibility is sometimes a concern but as the hostels are within the campus, students don’t find it cumbersome anymore.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">To start off with, IITG’s campus is spread over a massive 700 acres land. The campus is excellently maintained and is always neat and clean. Almost all the classrooms are air conditioned, with comfortable benches and projectors to make the lecture sessions quite modern. The library is well equipped with all the books and can be easily accessed at any odd hours. There is wifi connectivity within the campus, hence academic and non-academic work is easily conducted.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As a rule, all the students studying at the IIT’s reside in the college hostel. The hostels are located within the campus and the rooms are pretty decent. There is a facility for single rooms as well but most of them stay with a partner (obviously, we mean of the same sex). Roughly, there are 10 hostels in the Guwahati campus and are quite above average with neat and clean rooms and washrooms. Internet facility, LAN and wifi, are available in the hostels.</p>

												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs 56,600 per year<br> <a href="http://stupidsid.com/misc%20files/iitfees2013-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><em>View breakup of fees, hostel/mess charges &amp; fees for SC/ST students</em></span></a></p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">In one word, EXCELLENT! In spite of being located in small town and not ranked higher among the remaining IIT’s, the faculty at Guwahati is quite spell bounding. Most of the professors are PhD’s and have completed their doctorate from high ranking American universities. There is a facility for visiting faculties as well. Students are extremely satisfied with the level of teaching and communication. Some professors are definitely strict as they need to maintain the level of IIT while some are pretty lenient and gels really well with the students. Communication ain’t a problem as most of the lectures are conducted in English.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">A typical IIT crowd, BOYS! Yes, expect almost 90% of the students to be boys, some or most of them nerds. Since, IIT’s are the most respectable institute in the country and a dream college for any engineer aspirant, the crowd is extremely diversified. There are students from all parts of the country joining this reputed institution. Apart from studying regularly, students do participate in various hostel events and the college festivals. Ragging scene is nil and freshers are extremely happy with the same.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, one needs a JEE around 1000 to get a desired stream, generally Electronics and Computers. If you’re ready to compromise a stream to join this reputed institute, then a rank around 1800 or so will do. Anyways, these numbers are pretty difficult to get as one has to compete with tens and thousand lakhs of students.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">As a institute, IIT Guwahati is generally preferred after the metros. So, the standing would be around 5<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> in the country.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the 100% placements, which is a very common thing at the IIT’s, the companies that recruit students are class apart. From Facebook, Microsoft, Google to the banking sector which includes, AXIS, YES Bank, Nomura and hundred such companies visit the Indian Institute of Technology at Guwahati during the placement season. Well, salary is something would obviously look for. The average pay package would be anything around 7-8 lakhs per annum while the highest can go up to 30-50 lakhs depending upon your performance and the company status. International offers are less but they do reach up to a crore at times. Luring, right!</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Activities:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">At IIT, you see two things happening round the year. First is primarily and by default, studies. And second is the hundreds of competitions at national, international level, hostel activities and sports and the annual technical and cultural festival. These all keeps the students busy round the year. 'Alcheringa', the annual cultural festival of IIT Guwahati, is held in the first week of February while 'Technich', the tech festival, is held in late October. You can expect a footfall of around 10,000 students or more participating from all corners of India. Celebrities and politicians all chip in and make the event escalate to a larger scale.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">As the campus is located 20 kilometres from the main city, hangouts next to the institute are quite less and pretty boring. Students travel all the way to the main city for some delicious food and rocking movies. Thus, canteen becomes hot favourite place for the students, obviously after the library. It serves above average food which is pretty much edible and not heavy on your pockets. The mess food is just about average. Sometimes cold, sometimes not cooked properly but that’s the story in all the mess in India. So, students are quite accustomed to this fact.</p>

												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">We hate to give a verdict when it comes to IIT’s as it’s a dream college for any student. The Indian Institute of Technology at Guwahati has a reputed electronics department. Moreover, the design department is pretty rare in any engineering college in India which makes it the best one in the country. So, in short, TAKE IT provided you MAKE IT!</p>	</section>
