					<h2 style="text-align: left;">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Mandi started in 2009 and is one of the new IITs. It is developing faster than expected. It already has a functional main campus with 3rd year and Ph.D. classes going on in the main campus already. The main campus is located at Kamand, at a distance of 14km from town of Mandi. The institute as of today is placed slightly at a disadvantage due to not having been setup completely but due to the IIT brand it is likely to pick up fast.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Mandi town is a famous religious place with historical importance. It is situated on Delhi-Manali highway. The campus is 70km from Kullu, 110km from Manali and 150km from Shimla. Train and bus travel is convenient from Delhi and Dehradun. It offers you the opportunity to explore beautiful places. Main campus is somewhat away from suburbs. You can easily visit Dharamshala, McLoedganj and other beautiful places in Himalayas which you will crave to see when at home.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The main campus is coming up at great pace. It has a lot of open space, and you are free to move around, one is not forced into a shell. The weather here is such that you won't need an air-conditioner. Temperature here is generally 7-8 degrees less than Delhi, so fan at most will be needed. Computer labs and National Knowledge Network (NKN) rooms are air-conditioned by the way. Transient hostels are 2, 3 and 4 seater while at main campus, they are 2-seater and totally comfortable. Wi-fi is one of the best facilities available with an average speed of 2Mbps. Library and laboratories are equipped according to requirements and updated every now and then.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Courses Offered:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.Tech:</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Computer Science</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Electrical Engineering</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Mechanical Engineering</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
					<h3>Fees:</h3>
					<p>Rs 62300 per year<br> <a href="http://stupidsid.com/misc%20files/iitfees2013-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><em>View breakup of fees, hostel/mess charges &amp; fees for SC/ST students</em></span></a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Faculty is good, and the minimum qualification for a professor is Ph.D. Some of the faculty is from old IITs and some are newly recruited. Being a new IIT and a totally new curriculum, professors try to make studying interesting. As time passes once again the IIT brand value will attract professors and research scholars to join the list of faculty.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This factor disappoints a lot. The boy to girl ratio is around 10:1. We have students from across every state other than from the north east states. Hence crowd is quite multicultural. Students live in harmony and make great friends out here. Life on campus is one of the most memorable things to ever happen to anyone. Ragging is totally prohibited in here and we feel that it will stay this way since the germ of the ragging culture itself does not exist.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an IIT, it surely adds fame to the name of the college. It stands among the top 20 colleges of country. You need to have a JEE (Advanced) rank of 3000-4500(Gen) to get into IIT Mandi in the branches offered here. The college may become one of the best in the long run as it establishes itself.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies like Microsoft and Cisco have come and offered internships to 3rd year students. Around 75-80% placements took place this year. First batch of IIT Mandi went out this year and grabbed very good offers. Microsoft offered 16.5 lakhs to 3 students; Amazon took 1 student for 19 lakhs and many others at 6.8 and 9 lacs. Average package of CSE was around 9 lacs and overall it was 7.5 lakhs. Companies visiting apart from Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco Systems are DRDO, Samsung, TCS, Cognizant and Infosys among others.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best experiences at IIT Mandi is EXODIA, the tech-cultural festival which had a footfall of around 2000 people this year. It takes place at a very large scale and people from other IITs, BITS and many other colleges attended. Talking about sport events, there are two sport events every semester. Cultural week with Exuberance, Aakarshan and Hostel day are celebrated every year. Inter and Intra hostel sports and technical events are also held for the students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess/Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Mess is decent with edible food. They offer sweets twice while paneer and non-veg items are served thrice a week. Though sometimes you may feel the need to go out to escape from the common routine. You can visit Treat, Raj Mahal, Reagent Palms and Hotel RiverBank. There is a swimming pool and snooker point too. When we get free time we head out to new places (one day trip), as there are plenty of such places in Himachal Pradesh.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi<br> PWD Rest House, Near Bus Stand<br> Mandi - 175 001, Himachal Pradesh<br> Tel: +91-1905-237943<br> Email: regis[at]iitmandi.ac.in<br> Website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iitmandi.ac.in/">http://www.iitmandi.ac.in</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the IIT tag, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi offers great places around the college. Adventurous folks would certainly fall in love with the location. We feel the college will take a few more years to develop completely, so you may want to consider options in older IITs, BITS Pilani and a couple of the top NITs as better choices.</p>	</section>
