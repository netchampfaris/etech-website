																																																																																	<p>
																																																																																		Indian Institute of Technology - Hyderabad is probably the fastest growing IIT in one of the biggest industrial cities of India. There's a great deal of flexibility in designing of curriculum. New courses like fractional credit course and interdisciplinary branches such as Engineering Science are on offer. Being in a metropolitan city with huge number of research centers, labs and MNCs it has an edge over other IITs/NITs located in smaller towns. IITH can be considered a one of the best, if not THE best among new IITs.</p>
