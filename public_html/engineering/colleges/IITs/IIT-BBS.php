					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT BBS started in 2008 functioning from IIT Khadagpur campus and remained there for 1 year. IIT BBS is first of the new IITs to move out in search of a temprorary campus in its destined city i.e., Bhubaneswar. It is the only new IIT with civil engineering as its one of the discipline.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Bhubaneswar is as of now still functioning from a temporary campus with its main building known as IIT KGP extension campus in the heart of the city. There are a number of buildings taken by IIT BBS for its functioning. Biggest one is Toshali plaza building for first year students and civil engineering workshops.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus &amp; Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Though it lacks on sports facilities, IIT BBS provides all the facilities that other IITs provide. Apart from hostels full campus is air conditioned. The best thing which IIT BBS posses is hostel for third and fourth years. There are thee hostels - each of them located in different parts of the city and are quite far from each other. Hostels are quiet comfortable with a maximum of 3 student living with each other, it has both Wi-Fi and LAN access 24 hours. There is one main central library which provides just enough books to the students. Also there are all necessary labs with world class machine &amp; instruments for each discipline.</p>

										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
										<p>Rs 68600 per year<br> <span style="font-size: 11px;"><em><a href="/misc_files/iitfees2013-14.pdf" target="_blank">View breakup of fees, hostel/mess cha</a></em></span><a href="http://stupidsid.com/misc%20files/iitfees2013-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><em>rges &amp; fees for SC/ST students</em></span></a></p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there are many young members in faculty with little experience of past, overall faculty is world class.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">As it's an IIT, the crowd is bound to be multicultural. Boy-girl ratio though is about 11/1 which is poor compared to even the IIT standards. There are all kind of people from different parts of the country living together and involved in fun stuff. Societies/clubs are an integral part of the college life here. There is a great bonding within all batches. This may be attributed to absolutely no ragging stand of the senior students making juniors feel comfortable to gel up with them.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be ranked in top 20 among engineering colleges. It requires JEE rank from 2500-4000 though it changes every year. Changing branch is tough as minimum CGPA of 8.5 is required and only 10% of total strength is in consideration for branch change.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements &amp; Internships:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Internship cell has been working up to the mark many of the students went abroad for there paid internships, Placement is 90-95 percent every year with highest of 12 Lakh and average of 4 Lakh though it differs for each discipline. Top companies visited the campus are Samsung, ONGC, BPCL, L&amp;T are few of them.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess/Hangouts:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Mess provides edible food. That's it. Nothing great about it. Not many hangout places within the campus but certain malls in the city are common hangout places.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals &amp; Activities:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">It has two major festivals ALMA Fiesta - the cultural fest and Wissenaire its techno-management fest both of them have started to make a name in the eastern part of the country. Many activities such as cultural week, festival celebrations, sports general championship as a part of extra curricular activities are organised every year.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar (IIT BBSR)<br> Samantapuri (Rearside of Hotel Swosti Plaza)<br> Bhubaneswar - 751 013<br> Phone: +91 674 2301 982<br> Email:&nbsp;info@iitbbs.ac.in<br> Website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">http://www.iitbbs.ac.in</a></p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar being a new IIT is an advantage to a certain extent as it provides you to start new culture in the college rather than following old ones. Student should join if they can afford to go extra mile in every field and want to workout new things as there is no cooked culture for them to follow.</p>	</section>
