					<h2 style="text-align: left;">Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IITJ) Rajasthan</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3>Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Founded as one the 8 new IITs in 2008, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur emphasizes on multidisciplinary approach of study in its undergraduate curriculum and interdisciplinary specializations at the postgraduate level which we feel is something very new in the Indian education system. Jodhpur as we know it is “Sun City” with soaring temperatures in summer, ultra-cold winters and a place rich with cultural heritage and traditions. If you do choose to spend your 4 years here, observing fascinated <em>firangi</em> tourists looking around in rapture will become second nature to you.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite an urban area by itself Jodhpur, can be considered a big city. In terms of area the city of Jodhpur covers 22850 sq. km. and in terms of culture, it is perhaps one of the richest cities in the whole of India. The classes are held at MBM Engineering College which is about 17kms from the hostels and buses ply to-and-fro every 30 minutes. MBM campus is in the heart of the city while hostels are more towards outskirts.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus &amp; Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The facilities are amazing considering the fact that the campus is still temporary and hopefully the permanent one - likely to start from 2016 - will surely have the best of facilities. The class rooms, labs, discussion rooms and reading rooms are air conditioned. The hostels having flat system are also pretty amazing. In the 1st year, a 2BHK spacious flat is to be shared between 5 students while later on a 1 BHK flat is shared by 4 students. The rooms are spacious and clean and also have an attached toilet and bathroom in each flat which is regularly cleaned. Wi-Fi is amazing with 1Gbps speed. One can’t ask for anything better from the newer IITs.&nbsp;The library is not one which has gained too much of liking among the students.</p>

												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs 68750 per year<br> <a href="http://stupidsid.com/misc%20files/iitfees2013-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><em>View breakup of fees, hostel/mess charges &amp; fees for SC/ST students</em></span></a></p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The professors are decent considering the fact that the college follows a multi-disciplinary approach towards education. The professors are very helpful. All of them have secured a Ph.D. at least. Many teachers and faculty visit the campus as well. Some students here are said to be unhappy with the quality and number of professors. Like any typical college the type of faculty will vary from branch-to-branch and also on how you conduct yourself with them.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The type of crowd varies from branch to branch. On an average 1:9 is the girl:boy ratio and is better in the new upcoming branches. Large parts of the crowd are from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings and Branch Change:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally those having a rank anywhere between 1400 and 6000 in JEE advanced are admitted, wiith opening-closing ranks on the branch you wish to apply.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Branch change depends upon the student's capabilities. The rules for branch change are:</p>
												<ol>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">The changed branch cannot exceed more than 105% of existing strength.</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">The older branch must not have lesser than 75% of initial strength.</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">A minimum of 8 CPI is needed to be eligible for a branch change.</li>
												</ol>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The rest depends on merit.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Students take up internships in a variety of sectors such as Core, Consulting, Finance, FMCG's, Analytics, IT, NGO's and Government Institutions apart from the research internships taken up in various Indian and foreign universities. The jobs are also provided in the above sectors.</p>
												<ul>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">The highest salary offered was 17 Lakh per annum.</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">The average was above 9 LPA for CSE students.</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">For the rest of the students it was around 8 LPA.</li>
												</ul>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies ranging from Microsoft to Morgan Stanley and Flipkart come for on-campus placements.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 2 inter-collegiate festivals:</p>
												<ol>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Varchas: the inter college sports festival</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Ignus: the inter college techno-cultural and business festival.</li>
												</ol>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">These festivals have made a mark in the 2-3 years since their birth and are surely one of the biggest festivals in Rajasthan and India.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The intra-college festivals:</p>
												<ol>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Nimble: the technical festival</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Spandan: the cultural festival</li>
													<li style="text-align: justify;">Kridansh: the sports festival</li>
												</ol>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess/Hangouts:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Mess food is decent. Although slightly over priced but has a particular level of quality and hygiene. Apart from this you’ll find the regular run-of-the-mill maggi shacks and sandwich corners which is something common to all Indian colleges. Outside campus there is a CCD and McDonald’s not very far away approximately 1km from the campus. The nearest theatre is about 1.5 km from the campus.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur<br> Old Residency Road, Ratanada,<br> Jodhpur, Rajasthan - 342 011<br> Phone: +91 291 244 9024<br> Website:&nbsp;<a href="http://iitj.ac.in/" target="_blank">http://iitj.ac.in</a></p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The college enjoys a brilliant student culture and an all-round college life. Above all it’s an IIT with a decent name and statistics and has a lot to offer. It’s one of the best places to study. IIT-Jodhpur is definitely one of the better among the newer emerging IITs and will develop a strong foothold into the research and education field in the coming years, however we would suggest that you consider options even if they are off-beat branches in the top 5 IITs or good branches in BITS Pilani or the top 2 NITs, simply because the campus is yet to stabilize and with just a couple of graduated batches the alumni network is obviously not going to be any good compared to any senior institute.&nbsp;</p>	</section>
