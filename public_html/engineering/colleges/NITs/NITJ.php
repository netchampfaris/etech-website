					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology - Jalandhar (NITJ)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introduction:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology was started in Jalandhar in the year 1987 as a Regional Engineering College. In 2002, it was conferred NIT status and thus is an Institute of National Importance. Being one of the newer (younger) NITs, NITJ isn't as popular as the others, but is expected to quickly climb up the ranks.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NITJ is located in a rural area on the outskirts of Jalandhar. The campus is just off the highway, and is very close to an army camp. The nearby villages are quite developed (which means people there can watch cable TV), but to find proper civilization, you need to drive down to Jalandhar.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Since NITJ is one of the newer NITs, you could say that it's still in the development stages, but the infrastructure already is one of the best among the NITs. There is constant need for construction and reconstruction, especially since the strength has gone up considerably. The institute has a state if the art Mega-hostel that houses 1600 students, with a couple more of the same under construction. Even the older hostels are very clean and well maintained. The laboratories are pretty good, but the library is somewhat lacking in terms of infrastructure as well as books. Facilities for sports are absolutely fantastic - they have floodlit grounds and courts for all possible sports. The mess is pretty good, and the food is edible, but it isn't the extraordinarily tasty Punjabi food you might dream of / expect. Damn.</p>

										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Students give mixed reviews about the professors at National Institute of Technology Jalandhar. Although there's no doubt in their qualifications, some of the professors can be really stringent and orthodox, and at times even unreasonable. However, there are also those who are extremely liberal, and who share excellent rapports with the students.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">It's quite strict. Even the 'liberal' professors are very particular when it comes to attendance. Students are expected to maintain a minimum of 75 percent, failing which they are failed in the particular subject in which they fall short of attendance. Oh, it really happens.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though most of the students are from Punjab, they stress on the fact that the crowd bears no resemblance to the 'Delhiite Hooligans'. You wouldn't find boys driving flashy cars with deafening Punjabi music playing, and passing lewd comments at girls. People here are quite decent and very friendly, without getting creepy. The 5:1 boy/girl ratio is actually better than what you would see at most NITs, and it's ever-improving.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">There aren't too many activities to do once you get out of the college, which is probably why there are so many things to do within the campus itself. Of course, Jalandhar (like most other places in and around Punjab) is a food-lover's paradise, so you have umpteen number of dhabas and small eateries around, but that's about it.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">As you'd expect at any NIT, the college has 100 percent placements. About 40 companies participate in the placement process, and the average salary goes up to about Rs. 6 lpa. The highest salary is about Rs. 12 lpa, which is pretty awesome for a fresher.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">The technical festival, TechNITI is held in September while the cultural fest Utkansh is held in March.</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar<br> National Highway 1,<br> Jalandhar, Punjab - 144011<br> Website : <a href="http://www.nitj.ac.in" target="_blank">www.nitj.ac.in</a></p>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
										<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it is a relatively new college, but the chilled out environment and the lovely infrastructure ensures that you'll have good four years at NIT Jalandhar. Oh, and needless to say, the NIT tag will make a huge difference in shaping your career.</p>	</section>
