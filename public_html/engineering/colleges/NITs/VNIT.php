					<h2 style="text-align: left;">Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology Nagpur (VNIT)</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">When it was founded in 1960, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology was located in a then very remote area on the outskirts of Nagpur. The location is still the same, but the surroundings have improved significantly. The city is now easily accessible from the college, though it still isn’t really nearby.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Visvesvaraya NIT is built on a nice 235 acre campus. It isn’t a high-tech or flashy campus, but it’s quite optimum. The department buildings, some of which are new, are pretty good and well maintained. The labs in general, and especially in the mechanical department, are great. The residential buildings are decent as well, though they aren’t extraordinary. In the first and second year, a student shares his room with three more students, but housing for third and fourth year students is single-seater rooms. The classrooms are just about okay; sometimes the fans don’t work and it becomes tremendously hot. There isn’t much the VNIT has to offer in terms of sports infrastructure; they have a couple of grounds and a few courts here and there, but there’s no swimming pool and the facilities in place aren’t much to be too proud of either.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The reviews about the professors have been, in a word, mixed. While all the professors are certainly qualified, students sometimes complain about their willingness to teach, and their experience, or the lack of it. The mechanical department faculty is excellent, but the students from the electronics department are full of complaints about their staff.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This is probably why so many students flock to NIT Nagpur. The placements are excellent, with the college recording 100% placements on a regular basis. A number of students get what is called a ‘Dream Job’, and even those who don’t are normally quite happy at the end of the placement session. The average package is about 5-6 lac per annum. HPCL, IOCL, NTPC, Accenture, Infosys, Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung, etc are all regular hirers at VNIT.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd is a decent mix of the highly nerdy and the rather useless. There is obviously a higher percentage of Maharashtrians, though you’ll not find too many Mumbaikars. There are a large number of clubs that students are heavily involved in, so there’s a good level of interaction between them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The quality of food is surprisingly good, but some students just aren’t ever satisfied. There’s an all-night canteen on the campus, which is also a very common hangout for many students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the better NITs across the country, VNITs legacy and location will ensure that you have a good four years here.</p>	</section>
