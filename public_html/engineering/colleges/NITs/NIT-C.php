					<h2 style="text-align: left;">National Institute of Technology (NITC), Calicut</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introduction:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Technology, Calicut was previously known as Calicut Regional Engineering College. Established in 1961, it became an NIT in 2002 and is an institute of national importance. Apart from being one of the most sought after engineering colleges in the country, it is one of the few institutes in India to host it's own supercomputer. Yikes!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Now although it's called NIT Calicut, the college is far, far away from the city. A whole 22 kilometres away from Calicut, NITC is located in a rural area, with nothing apart from a few rivers around it.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Calicut is one of the oldest institutes in India, but the constant construction and renovation ensures that it doesn't look ancient. Yes, some of the buildings may look like they're from a long bygone era, but the management ensures that they are well maintained, and new, modern buildings come up on a more than regular basis. The students are provided with all facilities they might need; the college has good, air conditioned labs, a fantastic library, three tennis courts, two basketball courts, indoor badminton courts, grounds for football and cricket, and even a swimming pool. There is a mega hostel coming up, which would have all modern amenities, and house about 1500 students. That should take care of the fact that the current hostels are way too cramped and really not up to the mark.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Though there's no official ranking available, NIT Calicut is widely regarded as the fourth among all NITS.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">All the professors are properly qualified and maintain good relations with the students. A very healthy percentage of the staff is senior, and junior professors teach only first and second year students. NIT Calicut is currently mentoring NIT Sikkim, which is why a few professors have left recently for there, but that hasn't reduced the quality of staff, students claim.</p>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">Somehow, NIT Calicut doesn't have too many attendance issues. The degree of leniency in terms of attendance is department specific. The Comps department is said to have absolutely no problems if you don't attend, and even other departments aren't too finicky about it. Of course, there may be a few professors who get touchy about attending their lectures, so all you have to do is identify them and keep them happy.</p>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">When you come to an NIT, you can't expect to meet supermodels, and NIT Calicut is no different. The crowd is quite nice and very amiable, juniors and seniors share good relations with each other. Of course, this doesn't mean that ragging is absent - it does take place, but it's all done in good fun and never ever gets ugly. The one bad part is the awful boy/girl ratio, which is nothing more than 5:1. Oh lord.</p>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">The messes at NITC have a decent variety of Indian food, but it must be mentioned that most food is cooked in the typical South Indian style, which may not please too many taste buds. They have a canteen which is open till 3 in the morning, and serves all kinds of snacks at pretty reasonable prices. And much needed coffee, of course.</p>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">As you've probably read by now, NITC is in the middle of nowhere, so if you want to 'chill', you had better find some place to do so within college itself. Once you get out of the college gates, there's not much civilization for a good while, just a forest. A nice weekend getaway 30km away is Wayanad, and students often find themselves going trekking there, mainly because they have nothing else to do.</p>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">NITC hosts its annual technical festival, Tathva in September and it's cultural fest Ragam in March. Both attract participants from all over the country, and are always huge successes.</p>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>

															<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
															<p style="text-align: justify;">As a student claims, "an excellent place to spend four important years of your life".</p>	</section>
