					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) – Surat</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introduction:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute Of Technology, inaugurated in 1961, Surat was one of the 17 Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) that were established as a joint venture between the Government of India and the Government of Gujarat. In 2002 it was elevated to the status of an NIT, and thus is now termed an ‘institute of national importance’. Just like almost everything else in the state of Gujarat, SVNIT Surat has also come up really quickly and is constantly rising up the ranks.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">If you consider the NITs and IITs, most of them are located in the outskirts of cities. But this is not the case wit NIT Surat. SVNIT is located in a well developed area of the city, and is very easily accessible by autos and busses. It is located at Icchanath, at a distance of about 10kms from both, the domestic airport and the railways station. The location at the heart of the city gives students access to a number of restaurants and clubs, but unfortunately not bars (Gujarat is a dry state, remember?).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The huge 100 acre campus of SVNIT houses a sports center, the department buildings, a few small gardens and 14 hostels, the last four of which are newly constructed. Although the older hostels might show some signs of dilapidation, they have all basic facilities. What’s more, they’re going to be torn down and reconstructed very soon, and will then have all sorts of cool amenities. Work on a few of them has already started, and is going forward at a fantastic pace. A maximum of two students live quite comfortably in each room. All the hostels, departments and canteens are completely wi-fi enabled, and other parts of the campus are connected with high speed LAN. The laboratories in various departments are very well maintained, with ample amount of working equipments. The computerized central library has more than enough books, and is air conditioned. They have an excellent sports center where you’ll also find a hi-tech gymnasium; the college encourages all sorts of indoor and outdoor sports.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, it would be unfair to pass a verdict on the faculty as a whole. The reviews from students vary from department to department. SVNIT has excellent faculty in their Mechanical, Civil and Electrical departments – a healthy mix of senior and junior professors ensures that students are happy. The other departments lag far behind in this respect; while the professors are no doubt quite qualified, some of them may not be experienced enough. But one thing is common among all professors – they are all sympathetic to students needs and are very helpful. Some of the deans can be slightly harsh and uncooperative, but they ensure that students are never suppressed.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd and Campus Life:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As you would expect in any popular engineering college, the boy/girl ratio is prohibitively high. But not all is too bad; you see a very, very multicultural crowd at NIT Surat. The intake here is based purely on AIEEE, and the State Quota has also been scrapped, so what you get to see here is people from nearly every nook and corner of the country. Not just that – there are a number of students from neighbouring countries like Nepal, Afghanistan, etc. Students here, in spite of their varying cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, get along really well. SVNIT has been announced as a zero ragging institute and strict punishments are imposed on guilty students caught by the anti-ragging committee.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are heavily involved in various activities and sports the entire year. It’s a lovely place to be, really. The mess, well, is like any other mess – the food keeps you alive, but it’s certainly not a reason to be alive. Fortunately, though, Surat is known for its (vegetarian) food, and you can rest assured that you’ll never go hungry. There’s ISCON Mall, BIG Bazaar right in front of the campus gate, and a couple of malls with multiplexes just a short ride away. There’s also a small beach called Dumas at a fifteen minute ride.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">SVNIT is ranked among top 50 Universities in India and it comes in Top 15 NITs.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The placement scenario at NIT Surat is quite excellent. Every year, the institute has 100% placements. Most students have at least a couple of jobs to choose from. The average salary is about Rs.4 lac, but the highest salary offered goes as high as Rs.16 lac! Companies visiting the campus include the usual suspects like TCS, Accenture, Wipro, L&amp;T, and also specialized firms like Crisil, CitiBank, etc (clearly Finance is the new IT).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Events:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The major Technical festival of SVNIT is 'Mindbend' and is very popular in west zone, particularly in Gujarat. Along with this, the college also hosted 'Autofest', a fest mainly concentrating on automobiles, but it won’t take place henceforth. The main Cultural Festival is 'Sparsh' and this is also quite popular. Every year, hostel days are also celebrated by each individual hostel, organized by their respective hostel committees.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an NITian is a big enough achievement for most students, but at SVNIT you get a chance to be a part of something which has the potential to be much much bigger than just another NIT. You also get excellent exposure, and remember that living in a metropolitan environment will always give you an edge over a student who’s from a college in a remote area.</p>	</section>
