					<h2 style="text-align: left;">National Institute of Technology Silchar (NITS)</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This NIT is located in Silchar, a small town in Assam. Silchar being a small town doesnt have all the facilities that you would be expecting from a city, but still it houses some of the finest educational institutes, so students dont face much problems. Outside the NIT infra of the city is very poor but that is compensated by the scenic beauty it offers. Guwahati, the nearest city is about 7 hours drive and by flight it is just an hour. Connectivity by train is not good, so if you have motion sickness then be prepared to shell out a good sum of money.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Climate:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It rains most of the time here in Silchar as would expect, it being in Assam. When it isn't raining it is very pleasant.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The NIT complex is spread over 600 acres. The infra on NIT is good and very good compared to the town of Silchar. The location is picturesque and you wouldnt be wrong if you call this institute 'beautiful'. Truly. There is a sports complex being built in the campus which will be the biggest in the whole of North-East. This will give a big boost for sports here. There are huge galleries here where the lectures happen and for audibility the galleries are well equipped with speakers. All the labs are air-conditioned. Computer and Electronics department are centrally air-conditioned. There are cycles and buses in the campus to travel inside.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty here is well qualified as being an NIT there are certain eligibility criteria they have to follow. The core branches like the Mechanical and Electrical have brilliant faculty. They are very experienced and mostly scholars(Ph.D.)<br> Electronics and Computers have new faculty but in no ways are they to be underestimated.<br> There is not much emphasis on research, although some teachers may be involved but you dont see any from the students at all.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Like most of the NITs PSU offer jobs at NIT Silchar and also offer a handsome package. Core branches have good placements but the newer branches also are fully placed just with a lower package.<br> Mechanical - 6.5 lakhs (avg)<br> Civil - 4.5 lakhs (avg)<br> Comps, IT - 3.5 lakhs (avg)<br> Maruti and ONGC are some of the famous companies offering a good pay.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd at NIT Silchar is from all over the country. The trend here too is similar to other NITs where some students gel well with the rest whereas some stay aloof. Contrary to expectations students from the north-east arent in a huge number.<br> You tend to mix up well in the 1st two years as you have triple and double sharing of rooms. For the next two years it is a room per person.<br> You would find many couples in a place rightly called Lovers Lane.<br> After graduation most of the students go for M.Tech. There isn't any research work from students, it is just like another college in that matter.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen food isnt good, but wont go to an extent of calling it inedible. The main problem is that the food becomes monotonous after a while more than students disliking the quality.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology,<br> Silchar,&nbsp;Assam.<br> India, PIN:-788010<br> Phone:-03842- 224879 | Fax:-03842-224797</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the eminent visitor had said that the college is like a beautiful golf course. Apart from the scenic beauty it is a decent college for academics and sports along with. If you do happen to get this college do consider it, the only reason of it not being preferred is it being in North-east.</p>	</section>
