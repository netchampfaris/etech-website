					<h2 style="text-align: left;">National Institute of Technology, Durgapur (NIT DGP)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, is one of the more popular NITs. Founded in 1960, it celebrated its fiftieth year of existence in 2010, and has consistently had a history of producing excellent students. It is one of the leading institutes of national importance, which explains why it has such an important place in the heart of every West Bengal resident.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Durgapur, which is known as Steel City, is the second biggest city in West Bengal after Kolkata. Well connected by Rail and Road, the campus is quite urban, thanks to its excellent location in the heart of Durgapur. Kolkata is 160 kms away from Durgapur, which is not too much if you can tolerate the heat on the way.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Durgapur is one of only a handful of institutes in India to boast of a ‘high voltage laboratory’, and this one is the best of its kind. The library, most of the labs, and all the computer centres are airconditioned. They have 10 hostels here, seven for boys (with another one coming up) and three for girls. The new hostels, of course, have much better facilities, but the old hostels are definitely more popular. Each hostel has a mess and a common room. Final year students normally have a room to themselves, while second and third year students share their rooms with two or three other students. First years are put up in massive halls, and are kept regular tabs on.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The library is excellent – about a lakh volumes and ever-increasing. Students in their respective hostels have LAN access, but while in the departments there is access to WiFi as well.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are full of praise for the entire faculty. IT, CSE and ECE professors are very friendly and pretty cool too. The professors teaching core courses like EE, Mech, Civil, Metallurgy and Chemical are highly experienced and research work they do is, in the words of a student, ‘awesome!’ IT and BioTech professors are comparatively less experienced, but they are really good too. The college has been transformed by the new director, who has introduced some new rules to make sure discipline is maintained.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd, on an average, is pretty good. But the boy/girl ratio unfortunately isn’t. It depends on the department you’re in, of course, with IT,CSE,ECE having about 4/1 while branches like Mechanical have an appalling ratio of about 20/1! Students from almost all states join the college with preference from North and South India. Also, there are international students from places like Nepal, Bhutan and Dubai.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Students will vouch for the fact that life at NIT Durgapur is amazing. Yes, you’ll have to slog to get your grades, but it all seems worth it, when you take a look at the friends you’ve made and the times you’ve had.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Ragging has comparatively decreased a lot. An introductory session takes place, to get to know the students and juniors always stay in touch with their seniors, to know about departments and Clubs (NITD has Clubs which organize the extracurricular activities).</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there aren’t really any official rankings available, NIT Durgapur is widely regarded as the 5<sup>th</sup> best among all NITs, and among the top 30 in all engineering colleges of India. Of course, a lot also depends on the course you select. For example, NITD is the second best Indian college for Metallurgy.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">To get into NITD, you need to have a rank of anywhere between 1 and about 5000 in your AIEEE.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The college boasts of nearly-100% placements. Some of the top firms from across India and the world come and recruit here in numbers. Though the average is about Rs.5 lac per annum, Google and Amazon have come once in a while and offered whopping salaries of between 10 and 13 lac. Wow!</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Activities:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The Biggest fests of the college, which hold some amount of national importance:</p>
								<ul style="text-align: justify;">
									<li>'Aarohan' - The annual Techno-Management Fest of the College (February 2nd week)</li>
									<li>'Recstacy' - Cultural Fest. (February 3rd week)</li>
								</ul>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Other Fests and student activities, on a comparatively smaller scale:</p>
								<ul style="text-align: justify;">
									<li>Verve - Literary Fest (September)</li>
									<li>ANK - Knowledge Fest (Math events) (September)</li>
									<li>Motor Zundung - Auto Fest. (February 3-5th)</li>
									<li>Mukti - Open source fest (February 3-5th)</li>
								</ul>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Seminars and workshops take place from time to time, of course.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Mess food, as you’d expect, isn’t too great. There are a few canteens in the campus which are quite decent, and the food is pretty affordable. Of course, once you get out there’s a mall called Junction Mall which has BIG Bazaar, KFC, Pizza Hut and an INOX theatre too.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">While the weather can sometimes get to your head, these will definitely be four years of your life which you won’t forget (for the good reasons). Fifth among NITs and pretty close to Kolkata, NIT Durgapur is the East Indians dream.</p>	</section>
