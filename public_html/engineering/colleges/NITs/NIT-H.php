					<h2 style="text-align: left;">National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (NITH)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Hamirpur is one of the few places in Himachal Pradesh that can qualify (just about) as a 'city'. To quote a student, "by Himachal standards, this is pretty urban." the college is located at a whopping 900m above sea level, so you can imagine how picturesque the surroundings will be. There's a decent amount of civilization around; the marketplace is just 5 minutes away from college, and there are a fair few restaurants nearby as well.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Started in 1986, NIT Hamirpur is one of the newer NITs, and that's probably why it has fantastic infrastructure. The facilities available here are better than most, if not all other IITs and NITs. Many of the dormitories and buildings are brand new, and there's one mega hostel (which would house 1400 students) coming up. There are separate buildings for every department, all of which are either new or under construction. The fully wifi campus also has an excellent library as well, with books available whenever required by students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Courses Offered:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Hamirpur is ranked among the top thirty engineering colleges all over India.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are full of praise for all the professors, most of whom are PhDs from respectable institutes. Both, senior as well as junior professors are said to be very approachable, and quite friendly as well. There haven't really been any cases of professors holding grudges and reflecting them in marks, but students warn against taking the faculty for granted.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">They're quite strict about attendance here. You're expected to maintain a minimum of 75 percent, failing which you can get into all worts of trouble. If attendance falls below 60 percent in any subject, you'll have to repeat that subject. Of course, all these criteria get a little relaxed if you share a good rapport with the professor in question, but it's always advisable not to take a chance.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering that this is an NIT, the crowd is extremely decent. Most of the students are from Himachal Pradesh, which explains the calm, peaceful, friendly atmosphere. The general pleasantness is conducive to learning as well as mingling. The boy/girl ratio is about 5:1, but students say that it's improving every year. There is absolutely no ragging, but that doesn't mean that NIT Hamirpur is a boring place to be.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Hamirpur is a small city, there's not a hell of a lot to do outside campus, apart from visiting a few eateries, some temples, a couple of rivers, and the theatre (a rarity in Himachal). Fortunately, there are enough 'chilling' options within the college campus itself. You'll find a number of joints that serve delicious food (try the paratha!), a few cafes like Indian Coffee House, and a couple of shops like Amul, etc.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there aren't a terribly high number of core companies as compared to what other NITs see, the placement scenario in general is pretty excellent. NIT Hamirpur comfortably has 100 percent placements, with the average salary being around Rs.5 lac. Apart from the usual suspects like TCS and Accenture, the college is also visited by companies like Ericsson and Samsung on a regular basis.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The cultural fest, Hill 'Ffair and technical fest, Nimbus are major events at NIT Hamirpur and see participation from across the country.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur is certainly a nice place to be in. Lovely weather, a peaceful environment, and decent people around you. The only piece of advice students give is, "don't take it all for granted. Be nice to everyone and have a great our years."</p>	</section>
