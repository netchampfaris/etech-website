					<h2 style="text-align: left;">National Institute of Technology Warangal (NITW)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introduction:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Technology Warangal, started in 1959, was previously a Regional Engineering College (REC) but was conferred NIT status in 2002. It is an Institute of National Importance, and is widely regarded to be among the top three NITs in India.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">For all those who, like a few of us, didn't know, Warangal is in Andhra Pradesh. Located about three hours from Hyderabad, NITW is situated just off National Highway 202, on either side of it. Like is the case with many NITs, the college is the heartbeat of Warangal, which is a tiny, semi-rural town. Fortunately, there is good accessibility, especially to Hyderabad. The weather isn't that good, though; it's hot and dry throughout the year, with the only exception being the month of January, when it gets slightly chilly.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Since NIT Warangal is one of the older NITs, it would be silly to expect the college to be a paradigm of modern architecture. Efforts are being made to uplift the look of the institute a bit, but these things take time. There are a number of swanky new hostels coming up, and the newer departments have relatively better infrastructure than the others. The girls hostels are slightly lacking in terms of capacity, which means that many girls have to share rooms initially meant to house a single person. Many laboratories are in an abject condition, but students say that the situation is improving. The library is massive and is updated with the latest books on a regular basis. There aren't too many facilities for sports, however; just one terribly muddy ground and a decent badminton court.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT-W is said to be among the top three NITs, and among the top 20 engineering colleges in the country.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the quality (and quantity) of faculty varies significantly from department to department, the one outstanding feature of all professors is their high level of dedication. The Mechanical and Civil branch professors are singled out for praise by the students, but they also mention that the Biotech faculty isn't completely up to the mark. However, there aren't any complaints because students are very pleased with the rapport they share with their professors. Once in a while, yes, there are cases of teachers holding grudges against (and getting back at) students, but that happens everywhere, doesn't it?</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, all NITs have a mandatory 75 percent attendance rule. Some follow it to the book, some don't. NIT Warangal is one of those that try implementing it, and manage to do it, to an extent. Some professors are very strict about attendance, but many are on the lenient side, especially if you share good relations with them. It's advisable not to get too presumptuous though, because there HAVE been cases wherein students aren't allowed to write their exams due to low attendance.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there's a state-quota of 50 percent, about 75 percent of the crowd here is Andhraite, because they seem to do awfully well in the AIEEE and get into NIT Warangal by national merit anyway. Most of the students are quite friendly and decent. The girl/boy ratio is frankly awful though, at about 1:8.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Being one of the top colleges in India, NIT Warangal has fantastic placements. To give you an idea, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have been visiting the campus and offering a select few students brilliant job profiles with mind boggling salaries. You also have your regular recruiters from various sectors coming in. The average package is about Rs.6 lpa.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Warangal hosts it's technical festival Technozion in September, and its cultural fest SpringSpree in March. Both feasts see excellent participation from NITs across the country.</p>
