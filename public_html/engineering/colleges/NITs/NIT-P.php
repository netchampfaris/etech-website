					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology – Patna (NIT Patna)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Technology Patna is the 18th National Institute of Technology created by the Ministry of H.R.D. Government of India after rechristening the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering Patna in January 2004. NIT Patna marked its humble beginning in 1886 with the establishment of pleaders survey training school which was subsequently promoted to Bihar College of Engineering Patna in 1924. This made this institute the 6th Oldest Engineering Institute of India. The graduate level curriculum was later elevated to the post graduate level in 1978.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Patna is situated on the south bank of the holy river Ganga behind Gandhi Ghat, one of the most important and reverential place of Patna. The Gandhi Ghat is associated with the immersion of ashes of father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi in the river Ganga. The Institute campus is 8 Km from the Patna junction railway station and 20 Km from the Jai Prakash Narayan International Airport, Patna. The entrance to the institute is from Ashok Rajpath and it is about 3 Km from the famous Gandhi Maidan. The Institute is residential in nature and provides residential facilities to its students as well as teachers as per availability. Its 60 acres campus has a picturesque river view with eyecatching historic buildings presenting a spectacle of architectural and natural beauty.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Patna provides to all its students, employees and staff all the basic amenities that are required for a more resourceful and healthy development. A fully equipped Wi-Fi campus ensures uninterrupted 24 Hrs internet access at every nook and corner of the campus.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The institute provides residential facilities to students through three boys hostels and one girls hostel. The Institute maintains a central Library which has over 50,000 books and about 1,100 internationally acclaimed e-journals and works for about 10 hours per day. The library as well as all the computer labs everywhere in the institute are centrally airconditioned.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty at NIT Patna ensures that the atmosphere is very friendly. Although most of the professors are quite old, they’re very very well updated. The new teachers too, while not as experienced as their older counterparts, are quite learned and very approachable.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The boy girl ratio is roughly 4/1, which isn’t too bad considering that this is an NIT, and the added fact that it’s in, well, Bihar. People from every corner of India can be found here, but all of them are in agreement about the fact that there isn’t much to look forward to in the campus, apart from maybe the WiFi access. There’s no night canteen, and the library isn’t functional at night either. Fortunately, there are some places to go to once you step outside campus limits. Plus, there’s heavy construction work going on within the campus, so things are expected to improve sooner rather than later.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Ragging at NIT Patna is a strict no-no; juniors are treated as friends. Allegedly.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Though NIT Patna lacks a bit in infrastructure, students are firm in their belief that very soon, it’ll be among the top 5 NITs.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Every year, about 90% of the students get placed, and most are quite pleased with the jobs they get. The highest salary is normally about 10 lac per year, while the average stands at roughly Rs.4.5 lac per annum. Some of the companies that hire in number from NIT Patna are DRDO, IOCL, NTPC Ltd., Ispat Industries Ltd., Gammon India Ltd, ITC Infotech India Ltd., PGCIL, Infosys, Gati Infrastructure Ltd., Punj Llyod Ltd., L&amp;T, Vodafone Ltd., Tech Mahindra, HPCL, etc.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Activities:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Patna hosts its techfest called 'Corona' and cultural fest called 'Melange', for which technical colleges from all across India are invited. It also hosts a Saraswati Puja every year, which is probably the biggest in Patna.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Each hostel has its individual mess, which have their separate menus, none of which are exceptionally good, to be fair. There are two canteens as well, which serve decent food, but you have to pay for it, of course. Fortunately, there are a number of hangouts very close to college. Ganga Ghat right behind college is lovely and picturesque, and has few nice restaurants like Kapils Elevens, Purple Lounge, etc. A place called Haajipur is a very common place to hang out, and you’ll find a number of ‘late night parties’ taking place here.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology, Patna<br> Ashok Rajpath,<br> Patna - 800 005. Bihar.<br> Phone: +91-612-2371715 / 2371929<br> Email: registrar@nitp.ac.in<br> Website : <a href="http://www.nitp.ac.in" target="_blank">www.nitp.ac.in</a></p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">As some students mentioned, ‘NIT Patna is for grown-ups. Mama’s boys aren’t welcome here’. While that might sound intimidating, it’s not really too bad. And people who have a terrible, terrible impression about Bihar in the back of their heads will probably be quite surprised once they see this place. All in all, a decent college, and a very rich heritage.</p>	</section>
