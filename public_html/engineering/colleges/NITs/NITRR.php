					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Raipur is located in a pretty urban area right in the heart of the city. Just opposite the college you have Pandit Ravishankar University, which is the University of Chattisgarh.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Raipur, which was earlier a mining college, s roughly 50 years old, and somehow manages to look even older. The buildings are slightly dilapidated, and the hostels aren't up to the mark either. In fact, ever since the intake has increased, the hostels don't even house all the students - about half the students are made to live in the nearby town of Kota. New hostels are coming up, though, in their defence. The laboratories and classrooms are sufficient, but there's nothing special about them. The library is just about okay, with a very 'first come, first serve' environment, but fortunately has a huge reading room which can accommodate a substantial number of students. There are a couple of grounds for cricket, volleyball, etc but it'll be stupid to expect lush green grass - these grounds are RED. All in all, the infrastructure isn't really something that they're too proud of here at NIT Raipur.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Raipur, which is probably 12th or 13th among the NITs, is ranked about 60 all over India, as far as engineering colleges are concerned. For mining, though, people say that it's better than even the Indian School of Mining (ISM), Dhanbad.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where NIT Raipur really takes a hitting. For some reason, there seems to have been a massive clearance sale, where all (or most) of the good professors have left the college. The remaining professors aren't too great; very few are permanent faculty, and those who are, aren't friendly or approachable at all. There's a wide communication gap between students and teachers. One word of advice from the students - don't mess with the professors, you'll regret it. They describe the current scenario as the 'worst possible condition'.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The college expects students to maintain a minimum of 60 percent attendance, which students pretty much ensure that they manage to. Because of they don't, they have to face the wrath of their HODs, and more often than not are made to write long, irritating assignments.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd is quite friendly, although theres nothing exceptional about it. The girl/boy ratio is awfully poor in some branches (in mechanical its about 1:30), while it's better in branches like CS (1:6). Ragging is strictly prohibited.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few tiny malls nearby, but most students prefer spending quality time with Mother Nature. There are some 'jharnas' a few kilometres away, and a place called Donegarh Ghat that is frequented by students often. Other than that, they also like visiting the Bhilai Steel plant (don't ask us why, we have no clue) and a couple of other industries near the college campus.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any other NIT, Ranchi has pretty good placements. Especially when it comes to mining, where the placements are said to be better than ISM Dhanbad. More than half the mining students are hired by Coal India for a whopping 10 lpa. Companies like Samsung pick up Electronics students for salaries of about 8 lpa. The average salary here is about Rs. 5 lac.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact:</h3>
								<p>National Institute of Technology Raipur,<br> G.E. Road, Raipur,<br> Chhatisgarh - 492010.<br> Telephone : +91-771-2254200<br> Website : <a href="http://www.nitrr.ac.in" target="_blank">www.nitrr.ac.in</a></p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
								<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one of the best NITs; a high-ranking private college might be better. Heaven for mining, though.</p>	</section>
