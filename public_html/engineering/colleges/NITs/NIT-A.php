					<h2 style="text-align: left;">National Institute of Technology, Agartala (NIT Agartala)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introduction:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Technology, Agartala got upgraded to the status of an NIT only in 2007. Till then, it was known as Tripura Engineering College. Founded in 1965, the institute has been heavily involved in upgradation and reconstruction activity since only recently. NITA still isn’t quite up to the mark of the better NITs, but the management is trying to ensure that it reaches that level sooner rather than later.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">If you know your geography, you’d know that Agartala is the capital city of the very beautiful and picturesque state of Tripura. It’s in North East India, if you’re still wondering. The institute is roughly 20 kms away from the city of Agartala, but is pretty well connected by buses and trains. And you can always hitch a ride with some truck driver, since it’s just 4km off National Highway 44. As for the place, well, it’s lovely! Although the massive amount of construction going on in and around the campus somewhat ruins the natural charm of the place, it’s quite breathtaking anyway.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The huge NIT Agartala campus is ever growing and ever improving. Although it’s fair to say that currently the infrastructure isn’t the best, the college is making vast improvements. As soon as you enter the campus, you can see cranes, cement-mixers and other machinery. Yes, this isn’t pleasing to the eye, but at least it shows the ambition of the college. A number of new buildings with state-of-the-art facilities are coming up and should be completed by 2014.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the current infrastructure, it isn’t too bad either. The library is very well maintained, complete with a reading room and a book bank. Lecture halls are well ventilated, and all computer labs are air conditioned. The campus is fully wi-fi enabled. There are 6 hostels for boys, and 2 for girls, all of which are quite comfortable and cosy. The messes are decent too; students don’t normally complain about the quality of food, which isn’t something you see everywhere.</p>

												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Since NIT Agartala isn’t in the most metropolitan of places, it becomes hard to attract the best faculty. New professors are recruited every now and then from the better colleges around the country, so the situation is definitely improving. Old branches like Civil and Mechanical have excellent senior as well as junior professors, but the newer branches such as ECE and CSE (which were introduced here only a handful of years back) have relatively inexperienced and not-very-good professors.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd and Campus Life:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd here is quite decent; of course, there’s a majority of people from North East India, but you can safely say that people from all over the country come her. The Boy/Girl ratio is roughly 3:1, which is really not bad for an engineering college in a somewhat remote area. Many students are actively involved in sports and other extra-curriculars. One thing to be noted is that ragging is strictly prohibited here, and anyone found to be indulging in it is in for some serious trouble.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The mess food is more than edible and is often tasty, in spite of being healthy. And that’s a good thing, since there’s really nothing to do if you are to venture outside campus.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">There aren’t any official rankings available, of course, but students rate NIT Agartala among the top 15 NITs.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The placement record here is pretty good at NIT Agartala. Although the usual suspects like TCS, Patni, Capgemini, Accenture, etc visit campus and offer jobs in bulk, there are also a number of unique recruiters, especially for the core departments like Mechanical and Civil. About 90% of students get placed every year, and most of them in jobs of their choice. Regular recruiters, apart from the usual ones, include HCL, Maruti, Tata Motors, Powerwave, IOCL, Renault, Stone India, etc.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Internships are at a premium. Very few are offered, and even they don’t really pay too well. Most companies that pick up students for internships are local firms.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Events:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">The college doesn’t really host any major fest of its own, but various Hindu festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm. Durga Puja, Ganesh Puja, Diwali are all done on a grand scale.</p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">National Institute Technology, Agartala.<br> Jirania.Tripura-799055<br> Website: <a href="http://www.nitagartala.in" target="_blank">www.nitagartala.in</a></p>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
												<p style="text-align: justify;">Since it’s a college that was recently granted NIT status, NIT Agartala is certainly not yet at par with the best in the business. But a fantastic location coupled with its ambitious remodelling process ensures that it’ll definitely come up in the next few years.</p>	</section>
