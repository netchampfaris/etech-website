					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology, Srinagar (NIT SRI)</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Foreword:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Institute of Technology, Srinagar is one of the premier educational institutes in the Northern regions of the country. It was established in 1960 and has been one of the eighteen Regional Engineering Colleges sponsored by the Govt. of India during the 2nd Plan. The Institute acquired the status of National Institute of Technology with deemed-to-be University status during August, 2003 and attained full autonomy in its academics.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT, Srinagar is located in the Kashmir valley which, as you should probably know, is right up in the North of India. Surrounded by the scenic Himalayan ranges, the institute is situated at the banks of the famous Dal Lake.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campus and Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Srinagar boasts of pretty good infrastructure; decent hostels and very well equipped labs. A Central library has a collection of about 68,000 books of Engineering, Science, Humanities and about 6,000 bound volumes of journals, both foreign and Indian. The library has an ever-improving collection of CD's and video-cassettes on engineering, science &amp; technology. The library has a separate collection for SC/ST students having 10,000 books. Books are issued for full semester to SC/ST students. There is free online access to ASCE,ASME,ASPT, IEL, JCCC etc. journals through INDEST Consortium and has a complete collection of ISI codes in CD Rom format. The library is connected to IGNOU Educational programmes. This centre, which is in addition to the departmental computer centres, is open till late in the night.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Separate hostels for the boys and girls with separate mess facility are present. All the hostels are well maintained and are equipped with all necessary facilities, keeping in mind the climate of Kashmir. Jehlum hostel has been covered under the institute networking project, the work is going on and it is expected that each room will get net facility. In addition to this, other hostels are given a cyber cafe each.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">They have an excellent two story Medical Unit with 24 hours medical facility within campus, with a full time doctor and other paramedical staff. Medical lab facilities such as ECG, X-Ray etc are available on campus itself.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">They have excellent infrastructure in place for both indoor as well as outdoor games, with a Common Hall, and Activity Centre, and a number of fields for different sports.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT, Srinagar has a very dedicated and competent faculty in all disciplines. The institute boasts of numerous professors who are highly experienced, having experience of more than 20 years or so. They are also actively involved in research work.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The boy/girl ratio is about 1:7, but you can rest assured that you’ll see some of the most beautiful women you’ve ever come across once you set foot outside the campus. The institute has students coming from all over the country. To be very frank, life here is awesome. The weather is fine throughout the year. Previously, NIT Srinagar was rather notorious for ragging but due to laws passed regarding ragging and strict rules imposed by the institute, ragging isn’t really an issue.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rankings:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Srinagar is generally counted among the top 30 engineering institutes in the country. You don’t need a terribly high AIEEE rank to get in here, but that doesn’t mean that the institute isn’t excellent.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements and Internships:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 50 years, this institute has produced excellent engineers. The institution has maintained quality records and statistics of the students placement in the previous years. Top, top companies like IOCL, HPCL, ONGC, DRDO, TCS, Wipro, Mecon, SIMPLEX, IRCON, Punj Llyod, Samsung, Aricent, MU Sigma, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Reliance Power, Infosys, RITES, ACC, HCC, Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata motors, Kirloskar oil, Mecon, HLSA, Power Grid, NHPC, NTPC, ALSTOM, ABB, Nokia, Siemens etc. have recruited a number of deserving students from NIT Srinagar.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals and Activities:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NIT Srinagar has organised 'Techvaganza' in 2009 for the first time, and after that no techfest has been held. However, due to the recent efforts of the new director, few of the activities are organized brilliantly. No individual hostel activities are organized till date, though.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen/Mess:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The food in the mess is, well, just about okay. There are 3 canteens and 1 cafetaria in the campus which provide a variety of food.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As Srinagar is a tourist hub there are lots of places to hang out, notably Dal gate , Hazratbal shrine, Nigeen lake etc.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">National Institute of Technology, Srinagar.<br> Hazratbal,&nbsp;Srinagar - 190 006.<br> Jammu and Kashmir, India.<br> Phone: +91-194-2422032, 2420475<br> Website: <a href="http://www.nitsri.net/" target="_blank">www.nitsri.net</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">While the picturesque location in Kashmir should be enough to make up your mind, it should also be noted that NIT Srinagar is currently in a transitional phase under a new, ambitious director, and will definitely be regaining some of its lost glory very very soon.</p>	</section>
