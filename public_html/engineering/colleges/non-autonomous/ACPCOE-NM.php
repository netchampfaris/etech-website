					<h2 style="text-align: left;">Annasaheb Chudaman Patil (AC Patil) College of Engineering, Kharghar</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">AC Patil College of Engineering, fondly called ACPCE, is just a 5 minute walk from Kharghar railway station (Harbour Rly). One can also take a rick from the station if required.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure at AC Patil College of Engineering is decent, not over the top awe-inspiring and all, but simple and optimum. Classrooms are spacious and airy and labs are also good. The college is still under construction but first four floors are almost completed. Maintenance is good (except there is said to be a little leakage in the rainy season!!).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 94552/year</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This is probably the one thing AC Patil can be proud of. The math faculty is excellent. The other faculties too are good (at least in the first year, after that it doesn't really matter because you get immune to such things). Instrumentation and electrical faculty is outstanding. The electronics and telecommunication faculty is quite good throughout. Barring a few professors who are good, the computer science faculty is said to be average, and so is the I.T. faculty.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is very strict in the first year. They generally expect you to keep your attendance above 75%. If you do manage to have your attendance creeping really low, they might just take you to task. It is therefore advised to take the attendance part a bit seriously. Electrical and electronics dept. have a very strict pattern for attendance. The students are allegedly made to pay some nominal fine for low attendance. However, the detention practice has never been followed out here. Other departments have average compulsion on attendance and no serious problems are faced.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd in general is average. It actually depends upon luck. But the seniors are really friendly and helpful here. And also you do manage to find a decent, if not great crowd eventually. Most of the public is from “Dhule” (Patil). Quite good crowd, you would say, when you a give a thought to the distance at which it is located from Mumbai.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">AC Patil College of Engineering's canteen is only on the ground floor, so is out of reach for people from the third floor onwards (in the sense that one cannot make regular entries and exits to and from the canteen). It is clean and well maintained. Food is decent.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Kharghar is one place where you can have a lot of enjoyment. Most places to linger around are close to the college premises. There are 2 malls Little World and Glomax, hills for trekking and small ponds. There’s &nbsp;“Hiranandani” complex which is circumvented by restaurants of various cuisines and also hookah parlours.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">At AC Patil College of Engineering, technical festivals are held in odd semesters and cultural festivals are held in even semesters. Technical festivals differ from branch to branch. The cultural festival is called Rhythm.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Placements at A.C. Patil College of Engineering are decent. Campus placement in last three years with minimum salary, maximum salary and average salary is as given below:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Minimum&nbsp; : Rs. 1,08,000/- P.A.</li>
						<li>Maximum : Rs. 4,05,000/- P.A.</li>
						<li>Average&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Rs. 3,15,000/- P.A.</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact:</h3>
					<p>A C Patil College of Engineering<br> Sector 4, Plot No 17,<br> Opp. Kharghar station<br> Kharghar, Navi Mumbai - 410210.<br> Tel : 022 2774 5722/32<br> Website: <a href="http://www.acpce.org" target="_blank">www.acpce.org</a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A very good option for students with marks in the lower 100s. The location is, however, a minor glitch and traveling this far is a deterrent factor for Non-Navi Mumbaikars. So opt for it only if you think you can handle that.</p>	</section>
