					<h2>Anjuman-I-Islam Kalsekar Technical Campus (AIKTC), New Panvel</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Anjuman-I-Islam Kalsekar Technical Campus is located just about 1.5km from Khandeshwar Railway Station on Harbour line which translates to 7 to 8 minutes via share-rickshaws. Panvel Railway station is also not far – about 2km from here. Bus stop is also close by. Location is peaceful &amp; serene. Accessibility is also pretty good but travelling might be hectic if you stay in south Bombay or western suburbs.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Although it is still under construction, the campus of AIKTC is big and beautiful. As the college is new, infra is pretty much up to the mark. Classrooms are spacious with good LCD projectors and labs are well equipped. The library contains many books, CDs &amp; research papers. Air-conditioned seminar room is also there. There are 3 Wi-Fi zones on the campus. Hostels are not there currently but they’re in pipeline to be started from next academic year. Once they are finished with the on-going construction, it will have one of the best infrastructures among engineering colleges in Navi Mumbai area.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs 63,270/- per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the teachers at Anjuman-I-Islam’s Kalsekar Technical Campus are fresher &amp; junior. However they make up for their inexperience with their efforts &amp; co-operative nature. You wouldn’t need to join any tuitions or classes if you attend lectures regularly.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">College is too strict about attendance and if students fail to maintain 75%, parents are called up.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the religious minority quota, majority of the crowd is Muslim.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">College canteen was started recently. It’s really good. The food is hygienic and affordable.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s nothing nearby the college to hang out at but campus is big and pleasant so students usually chill here. Once in a while you can go to Kharghar, where there are many restaurants and stuff.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">None</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing can be commented about placements as the first batch is not out yet.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to nice infrastructure, helpful faculties &amp; a receptive management, Anjuman-I-Islam’s Kalsekar Technical Campus seems to be a good college in the making.
