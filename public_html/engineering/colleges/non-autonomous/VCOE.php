					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Vidyavardhini’s College of Engineering (Vartak College of Engineering), Vasai</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Vidyavardhini’s College of Engineering and Technology (VCET) popularly known as Vartak college is located in sVasai. It is a couple of steps away from from Vasai railway station; hence no issue of spending for rickshaws and the BEST buses. The Gurudwara and the Jain temple are the best landmarks to the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a five storey building with quite a decent campus. But as the crowd isn’t great, the campus is usually empty. It has a good vehicle parking space. The classrooms aren’t appealing and the fans are said to not work sometimes as well. The laboratories are without AC’s which is one of the biggest drawbacks during summers.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 94,545/- year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The teaching staff at Vartak college of Engineering is decent and has a command on their language and knows their subject quite well. On the whole an above average faculty.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very strict. 75% is a MUST. Moreover, if the attendance is low, the college authority makes you write a NOTE which puts a compulsion on you that next time the attendance has to improve, else some SERIOUS action. Parents, too, are said to have been called many times.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Vartak College of Engineering doesn’t have any quota so there is no majority of a particular caste here. Since the college is located really far in the Northern suburbs, most of the students are from the western and North Central suburbs. Overall crowd is said to be serious and not fun-loving which spoils the enjoyment section of four years of engineering.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen at Vartak college of Engineering is OKAY. The food variety isn’t too much and the cost is also high. Your home-made <em>dabba</em> will be a smart choice.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Various food outlets like Domino's &amp; Garcia's pizza, Andy's Burger and roadside food stalls have cropped up near the college. You can also expect to meet all your college buddies in the very famous KT cinema which is close to the college. The other enjoyments are very far from the college which would amount to like a one-day trip.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Cultural festival: Zeal (Feb-Mar)<br> Technical festival: Orion (Sept-Oct)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It is said that the placements aren’t 100%. The companies recruiting students in the streams like EXTC, Computers and Mechanical are&nbsp;really good. The rest are said to face some problems. &nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Vidyavardhini’s College of Engineering, Vasai</span></address><address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Vasai Road, K.T. Marg, Thane, Maharashtra</span></address><address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Website : <a href="http://www.vcet.edu.in/" target="_blank">www.vcet.edu.in</a></span></address>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Verdict:</span></h3>
					<address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Vidyavardhini College of Engieering and Technology comes out to be one of the finest colleges in the Far-north-west region of Mumbai as far as academics is concerned. But it's difficult to say because of lack of better colleges around or because of the college's own qualities. Crowd, location and hangouts are a huge turn off.</span></address>	</section>
