					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering, Chunabhatti</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Padmabhushan Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's College of Engineering is located on the Eastern Express Highway, close to Everard Nagar at Sion-Chunabhatti, offering easy accessibility by road and rail. It is surrounded by a sewage canal on three sides and marshy areas with slums here and there on the fourth side. Nearest Railway Stations: Chunabhatti (Harbour Rly.),&nbsp; Sion (C.Rly.) and Kurla (Harbour &amp; C. Rly.)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Strictly Ok. However there's a ground for volleyball and cricket. The classrooms are packed and messy at times. However the labs are well organized.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 78450/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The less said the better. The lecturers are missing half the time and complete their portions in haste later on. Students without personal coaching often find themselves in trouble.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance used to be really lenient for the previous years. Owing to the change in the management and principal roping in, the attendance has become pretty strict. Students are asked to attend 75% of the lectures failing which term marks will be reduced, loads of assignments will be burdened on your shoulders, and for worst cases, parents will be called.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of them are studious. They possibly watch one movie a year and would hang out with friends once in a blue moon! However, there some decent Pseudo-Intellectual people too and yes not to forget the totally “Mawali” crowd.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Real bad! You would torture your taste buds. I'd rather prefer skipping my meal than to even dare step into the canteen of Vasantdada Patil College of Engineering! The Chinese food is edible if at all you have to have your meals in there.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The only decent and nearest hangout place would be the Multiplexes “Imax” at Wadala and “Cinemax” at Sion. Good restaurants can be found but only in Sion, which isn’t very close to the college. The canteen serves as the regular hangout for most of the students due to the lack of any other joints near the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Sports fest - Sports festival</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fusion - Cultural festival</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fission - Technical fest</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Tantra - Tech-cum-cultural festival</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Eligible students are offered placements at some of the best companies like Essar, Polaris, HCL, LG, Sahara. The salaries offered are from 1.8 lakh to 3.3 lakh per annum with an average of 2.46 lakh p.a.. Unfortunately, though, not too many students are eligible.</p>
