						Viva Institute of Technology (VIoT), Virar</h1>
						<hr>
						<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
							Location:</h3>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Viva Institute of Technology (VIoT) is located in the northern extreme suburb of Mumbai on western railways – i.e Virar. It is in a a slighly hilly village called Shirgaon, and college is surrounded by beautiful greenery on all sides. It is about 7.5 km from Virar railway station and reaching here is very inconvenient as public transport namely ST buses make you wait too long and rickshaws in this region do not follow meter, hence are very costly. College buses to &amp; from Virar Station are available at specific timings. Most people seem to use them due to lack of other decent commuting options.</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									&nbsp;</p>
									<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
										Infrastructure:</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">
											There are two college buildings, one of which is still under construction even after quite a few years since its inception. One building houses classrooms, libary, teacher's room, administation et cetera and the other one is used mainly for labs and workshop. Labs for Civil, Mechanical and Computers are good but Electrical don't have any and those students have to conduct their experiments in other departments' laboratories. Their library is poorly lit and students never feel like studying there. Surprisingly there is a well equipped gymnasium cum gymkhana. Wi-fi internet is available but students don't get to use it too often either due to connectivity issues or due to not getting permission. Infrastructure is still developing but at very sluggish pace and students often wonder where does the money paid by them as fees go, if not in infrastructure?</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">
												&nbsp;</p>
												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
													Fees:</h3>
													<p style="text-align: justify;">
														Rs. 90,000/ per year.</p>

																Faculty:</h3>
																<p style="text-align: justify;">
																	Faculty at Viva Institute of Technology is not bad, average. Although most of them don’t have much experience in teaching and are only fresher, they manage to teach well somehow. The experienced professors are very good. Faculties for Electrical are the best of all. For EXTC, Civil and Mechanical too faculty is good except that they're strict in EXTC. Some of the teachers are rude and egoistic but most of them are helpful and understanding.</p>
																	<p style="text-align: justify;">
																		&nbsp;</p>
																		<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
																			Attendance:</h3>
																			<p style="text-align: justify;">
																				College is strict with attendance. 75% is a must. Else you term work marks are at stake. To score full attendance marks you have attend more than 90% of the lectures. Anything below 75% and you are in for trouble.</p>
																				<p style="text-align: justify;">
																					Apart from strict attendance there are some weird disciplinary rules are in place such as - you can't wear round nech tees nor can you wear printed ones and slippers/flip-flops are not allowed. These rules are followed strictly.</p>
																					<p style="text-align: justify;">
																						&nbsp;</p>
																						<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
																							Crowd:</h3>
																							<p style="text-align: justify;">
																								Majority of the students come from urban areas. Most of them also come from the North-Mumbai. There are hardly anyone coming from beyond Andheri on western line. The crowd is pretty decent.</p>
																								<p style="text-align: justify;">
																									&nbsp;</p>
																									<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
																										Canteen:</h3>
																										<p style="text-align: justify;">
																											It is a very small canteen and seating arrangement is also quite poor. There are only a few tables and its accompanying chairs for over 1000 people from different courses offered on the same campus like engineering, MBA, science, pharmacy and architecture. So it gets invariably crammed up during break. At other times too it is overcrowded. Luckily quality &amp; taste of food is decent enough. And there are whole lot of variety on the menu as well.</p>
																											<p style="text-align: justify;">
																												&nbsp;</p>
																												<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
																													Hangouts:</h3>
																													<p style="text-align: justify;">
																														Sadly there are NO hangouts for around the college as it is located in a remote, rural area. Nature lovers will rejoice as there are some hillocks, a dam, many trees and never ending fields around the college. And yes, a western cafe (local tapri) is newly opened outside the college.</p>
																														<p style="text-align: justify;">
																															&nbsp;</p>
																															<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
																																Festivals:</h3>
																																<p style="text-align: justify;">
																																	Hiteshi is cultural festival and each department conducts its own technical fest. Most students see them as a mere formality and only a handful of them truly participate. Support from staff and management is also meagre. However, their sports week is a big hit among students and good ammount of participation is seen.</p>
																																	<p style="text-align: justify;">
																																		&nbsp;</p>
																																		<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
																																			Placements:</h3>
																																			<p style="text-align: justify;">
																																				The placements for first batch (passed in 2013) were disappointing. Very few companies came for campus recruitment. Hence only a handful of students were able to bag jobs and that too in local cos. like Raw Engineering and Parekh Aluminium. No placements for Electrical department. Average salary was around 1.5 Lakh and highest was 1.8 Lakh per annum.</p>

																																									Verdict:</h3>
																																									<p style="text-align: justify;">
																																										Viva Institute of Technology (VIoT) is a comparatively a new college. Good faculty is favourable factor but there are many more adverse factors like accessibility and placements. However, students studying here are hopeful that things will improve over time. Those scoring below average in entrance exam usually opt for this college.</p>
