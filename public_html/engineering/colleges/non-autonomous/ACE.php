					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It takes about 15 to 20 minutes by rickhaw from Kandivali or Malad railway stations (W. Rly.) to reach Atharva College of Engineering. Some prefer to travel by BEST buses as 9 out of 10 buses from Malad drop you right outside the college. BEST buses run with a good frequency on the Link Road and next to the college. Not a very impressive location but good enough to survive for 4 years.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
