					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT), Andheri</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3>Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT) is a 15 minute ride by rick from Andheri railway station (W. Rly. &amp; Harbour Rly.) and shares the same campus with the very famous Bhavans college. Due to the ongoing Metro work since the last few years, the roads are in dilapidated condition and don't be surprised if the&nbsp;<em>autowallahs</em>&nbsp;blatantly refuse to ferry you to the college. BEST buses to the college are equally unmotivating. Students who travel by train, most of the times, prefer to walk while &nbsp;a few opt for the share rickshaw on the SV Road.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT) has one of the largest campus amongst the engineering colleges in Mumbai of which SPCE is also a part besides Bhavan's college and one of the most sought-after B-School in the country SP Jain Institute of Mgmt &amp; Research (SPJIMR). SPITs building is well furnished and the infrastructural facilities are top notch. Lack of ACs might pull it down a bit but the natural environment is a plus point. Overall pretty decent infrastructure.&nbsp;Classrooms are good and washrooms are very much decent as compared to SPCE. Library is very much equipped with truckload of books.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The campus also has a hostel facility considering it hosts two engineering, one management and a degree college respectively.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">BTech Fee: Rs. 1,15,500/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">MTech Fee: Rs. 90,000/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>Excellent records and scores over most colleges. It is one of the oldest colleges in Mumbai and hence has a fantastic name and a legacy attached to it. Round about 50%-60% of the students apply for placements, while the rest go for higher studies. Over 100% placement record, with many students getting multiple job offers. Students from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT) are placed into companies like Infosys, Accenture, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and so on. Average salary is around Rs. 4 lakh p.a. A number of companies offering really fat salaries are also part of the campus recruitment.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology is pretty good. They have enough knowledge about the subject to teach and clear your doubts, if any. Not very strict. Students from the reservation backgorund find the teachers extremely helpful as apart from academics, they do help in solving their personal problems.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is not too strict as well. A minimum of 60% of attendance in all subjects is required. Test marks carry more weight-age over the attendance. But with the crowd that you find in the college, most often you end up attending lectures.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p>Being one of the top rated colleges in Mumbai, SPIT has a very studious crowd. Definitely you will meet many nerds and geeks. A bunch of cream crowd can also be expected followed by students from the reserved category. Eventhough it is located in the western suburbs and has a 'not-so-accessible' location, students from every possible nook and corner of the city are seen here. Good fun loving life. "<em>Khao, Piyo, aur Aish Karo</em>", quotes a student.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen is pretty big as compared to other colleges, but with 7 branches (SPCE and SPIT combined), it seems a little small. The menu is good ranging from punjabi to chinese to Indian to South Indian. There is a sandwich counter as well. The menu is decently priced. Apart from the canteen, great snacks are available right outside the campus and franky, boy!.. that's a hot favourite among the students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p>On Campus: Quadrangle and Katta at SPIT entrance, Bhavanâ€™s ground, Auditorium, Amphitheatre, Lake (Boating Facility use to be Available!!) and you can spot a lot of interesting insects around.</p>
					<p>Off Campus: Malls (Fun Republic, Citi Mall, Infinity Mall), Loads of places in Lokhandwala.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p>'UDAAN' - replaced SPACE as the annual cultural Exravaganza, which had a history of 28 years.</p>
					<p>'NIRMAAN' - Annual Technical Festival</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
