					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, popularly known as (BVCE) is only 8 min away from Kharghar railway station on harbour line by foot.

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering has great infrastructure. They have put in lots of efforts in beautifying the campus and it clearly shows. The building is huge with almost one floor being dedicated to each department. The classrooms and labs are well maintained. Equipment in labs are up to the mark. There is a vast campus where students play football, basketball, cricket etc. Sports kits are also provided. One minor glitch is of irregular electricity supply but it isn't much of an issue. And you need to beware of the CCTV cameras which are actually used to monitor students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Approx Rs. 85,000/year</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">About 70% of the teachers are experienced at Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering (BVCoE). But most of them are said to have some problems when communicating in English. However, the students seem to be quite satisfied with the quality of teaching and a few who opt for coaching classes feel stupid now. Faculties are friendly and doubts are welcome.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd is above average and mostly comprises students from Navi Mumbai. Few students do travel all the way from Western Suburbs also. The EXTC department is the most active. Students of other departments are enthusiastic but they sometimes loose out due to lack of support from their departments. Boys to girls ratio is about 65:35.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">BVCoE has a fantastic canteen. It is clean, hygienic and food served here is delicious and pocket friendly. The canteen is also really spacious. All varieties of vegetarian food are available here. It is so good that students don’t prefer going out of the campus and eating.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many joints favored by the students near Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering like Café&nbsp;9, Baghdadi, and Virgin Street Café.
