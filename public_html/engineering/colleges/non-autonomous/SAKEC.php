					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC), Chembur</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC) is pretty equidistant from both - Govandi and Chembur Railway Stations on Harbour line, yet students prefer to commute from Govandi. Several BEST buses drops you on the highway which is two minutes walking from the college. Accessibility is not a big issue here.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure is definitely not breathtaking, but is simple and decent.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The campus is a bit small (way smaller than most colleges, partly due to the fact that the ground is a one minute walk from the main premises) but the quality of the classrooms and labs is quite good. Maintenance is good (except for the ground which starves without grass, however the student community is trying hard to change this). Library is stocked with good number and variety of books.</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 116221/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the few things students say Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC) is good at. The math faculty is brilliant. The other faculties too are decent (at least in the first year, after that it doesn't really matter because you get immune to such things). The electronics faculty is quite good throughout.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Computers&nbsp;faculty is average; so is the IT department. Students say some teachers can make life pretty difficult, but that’s always there.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is a bit strict at Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC). The college generally expects you to keep your attendance above 75%. If you do manage to have your attendance creeping really low, they might just take you to task. It is therefore advised to take the attendance part a bit seriously. Or else if you do know your way up the hierarchy ladder, things might be compromised but a fat chance there for F.E.s and S.E.s (hard luck fellas).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd at Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC) is average. It actually depends upon luck but the seniors are really friendly and helpful here. And also you do manage to find a decent, if not great crowd eventually. Loads of Kutchhis though, after all it has 50% quota for Kutchhis.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2012, the college has <strong>NO</strong> Kutchhi Minority Quota. The college now has 50% Jain Minority Quota.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Ah! The so called canteen... hmmm. Sadly, the canteen is shared by the polytechnic and the degree guys, and being small and crammed , it doesn’t really help! The food found is quite decent. But there are a certain hygiene issues</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warning:</strong> The canteen becomes a furnace during 12:15 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. and the crowd will simply get to you. The Nescafe stall separate from the canteen and Desai <em>snakes</em>&nbsp;(Okay, that's what you hear very often, don't you?) stall are pretty popular within the camous. These stalls cater good stuff!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Wrong question, my friend! No 'hangouts' at walking distance but if you don’t mind minimum auto fares, there is Barista, Acres Club, Ambrosia (decent food though it is tiny), etc. Most of the college ‘crowd’ chose to go home instead!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Nucleus is the technical festival of Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC) held in February-March. Verve is the cultural festival which is held around the same time as Nucleus. Olympus is the Sports festival.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Placements are decent. If you have decent percentage followed by good aptitude skills, you most probably will get placed. (stating the obvious, isn’t it?). TCS, Tata Infotech, Reliance Infocomm, Patni Computers are the major recruiters offering salaries around Rs. 2 lac/year to Rs. 2.2 lac/year. More than 50% placements for all departments with Electronics leading.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC) is a very good option for students with CET marks in their lower 100s. The location is, however, a minor glitch and a deterrent factor. Also, you’ll be around a lot of Kutchhis, as the name suggests. They’re a cool bunch, overall, but make an informed choice if you’re picky.</p>	</section>
