					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">MES Pillai's HOC college of Engineering &amp; Technology (PHCET), Rasayani</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Pillai’s HOC College of Engineering&nbsp; &amp; Technology&nbsp; is located in a small place called Rasayani. It is 14 km from Panvel. You can reach the college by Train (Rasayani station, on Diva-Roha railway). ST buses and sharing autos are also available from Panvel and Rasayani stations. However, most of the students (&amp; teachers) prefer to travel by college buses. Stops for college bus are Khanda Colony, Panvel S.T. Stand, HDFC circle &amp; Panvel Railway station.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Pillai’s HOC educational complex is a huge campus and houses many colleges and schools in it. Engineering college has a 10 storeyed building which is still under construction.&nbsp; Class rooms are not air-conditioned, but students are hopeful that it’ll come in the near future. Washrooms are neat &amp; clean. Labs are not up to the mark, with less number of equipment. Some of the labs need to be shared with diploma students. Library is common for all the colleges, but has all required books and it is spacious too. The playground is huge, perhaps largest in Mumbai colleges. Sadly there’s no gymkhana.<br> <br> Hostel facilities are available in the campus. Hostel is good and has all the basic amenities. Hostel charges are Rs.4000 per month but he food at the mess is bad. Students can find alternative mess in Mohopada, a nearby village. There are some people in the HOC colony who provide cheap &amp; good home-made food.<br> <br> Not a single student is satisfied with presently available infrastructure, but again students are hopeful that with time it will improve.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 98793/- per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Faculties for EXTC, Mechanical and Civil are good and highly knowledgeable. For other branches there is a mixed lot with a few experienced &amp; knowledgeable teachers and the rest not that good. Formal communication takes place in English. All the teachers are approachable. They’re said to be strict about attendance and completion of assignments on time.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance in Pillai HOC College is too strict. You can avoid some of the penalties if you maintain a good rapport the teachers. There have been a case or two where they have not allowed the candidate to sit in the university exams</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd and campus life:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the crowd comes from Panvel and nearby areas. Outsiders also prefer to stay in Panvel, instead of college hostels. There are more girls compared to other engineering colleges. Engineering students are fun-loving but other courses students hail from villages and love to increate troubles. Campus life is peaceful. Extracurricular is awesome. There'll be a lot of Malayalam speaking crowd due to linguistic monority.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Nearby temples and Dam. Nothing more can be expected from such a location anyway.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Not so great. Serves edible food.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">X-U-BERANCE is the annual cultural intra-college fest for entire campus. It is held in February or March.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">First batch has yet to come out, so nothing can be said till then. The proposed plans are that there will be group placements with PIIT students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
