					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE), Airoli</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) is located quite conveniently close to Airoli railway station on the trans-harbour route. The campus is just about 5-6 minutes away from the railway station and its not a very bad walk either.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) takes a hitting somewhat. As of now, it doesn’t really have anything like a ‘campus’, it’s just a building. The building however has been newly constructed and the labs are well-equipped, which is not something every engineering college can brag about. So those who intend to spend a good few years in engineering could definitely look at it as an option.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.E. Fee: Rs<strong>. </strong>103866/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.E. Fee: Rs. 79,000/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Placements:</h3>
					<p>This is why some students go all the way to Airoli. The placements in general are pretty good, with companies like Infosys and Patni taking students in big numbers. The Civil Engineering department has an excellent placement record of 100%. Chemical and Mechanical Engineering departments have below average placements, though. The Chemical department, in particular, has really underwhelming placements. Overall placements are about 50%.</p>
					<p>Major companies visiting campus: Infosys, L&amp;T infotech, Wipro, IBM,TCS</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">They say you’ll be safe if you maintain around a 60%, which isn’t too bad. Even if you find yourself well below that mark, no ‘strict action’ as such is reportedly taken at Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE). Probably a couple of assignments or test papers to be written. Fair enough.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) faces a problem very similar to most colleges located in village-like areas- village crowd. About 40% of the crowd comes from villages. Most students say it’s better than the general Airoli crowd, but doesn’t come close to the colleges in Mumbai. Thank you for that.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The students say the canteen at DMCE is not worth describing, which we assume means that its quite rubbish. What they did tell us, though, is that there have been cases of students having to be admitted to hospitals after eating from the canteen. Oh dear!!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">To quote a student, ‘You cannot hang out in Airoli!’. Students have to travel all the way to Nerul, Vashi and Kharghar for a typical mall hangout.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Datta Meghe College of Engineering host their cultural fest Milestone in the months of Jan or Feb, and the technical fest (having the original name Technitude) in the month of March.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE),<br> Plot No.-98, Sector 3, Airoli,<br> Navi Mumbai - 400 708.<br> Tel No :+91 (022) 27692854, 27691662, 27697130, 27603299<br> Website: <a href="http://www.dmce.edu/" target="_blank">www.dmce.edu</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Not a bad college, not bad placements, but if you’re going for the crowd, don’t go to DMCE.</p>	</section>
