					<h2>Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT), Vashi</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It takes about 5 minutes by rick from Vashi Railway Station (Harbour Railway) owing to the good roads and scarce traffic in Vashi to reach Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT), also popular known as "Agnel Vashi". You'll reach the colelge in minimum fare or just slighly above that so it's a good idea to share the rick between 2 or 3 people. Walking is also not a bad option as it doesn't take more than 15-20 minutes.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT) has a four storeyed building which houses the lecture rooms, faculty centres and most of the laboratories. It is connected to the two storeyed computerized library at the centre of the academic block. It has a WiFi network on campus but it is made available only after 6p.m and you have to go through some registration process which will surely make you give up eventually. Other facilities available to the students include a cafetaria, a football ground, 5 basketball court, a gymnasium, medical centre and the hostel facilities housed in the twin 7 storeyed hostel buildings in the campus. There is even a swimming pool and students can use it twice a week at a nominal Rs 15. Overall, the infrastructure is top-notch.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">BTech Fee: Rs. 119,526/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">MTech Fee: Rs. 122,135/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>The institute “claims” to have a nearly 100% conversion ratio of eligible students to company offers.&nbsp;TCS, Infosys, ATOS, Capgemini, L&amp;T, Siemens, Godrej and Boyce are some regular recruiters.&nbsp;Average package: 3.25L. Placements for core branches is as good as computer/IT branches.</p>
					<div>&nbsp;</div>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Excellent. Faculty is <em>actually</em> good in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering streams of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT). Although, the same cannot be said about the Computer and IT faculty, it's much better than many of so-called top institutes. Teachers&nbsp;make sure the portion is completed well within time. Presentations are made by the teachers so that the students understand better. Doubts are always welcome. The faculty makes sure that at the end of the semester the student is well versed with the subject.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very strict. Term work marks are given in proportion to your attendance starting with zero marks for 75% attendance and 5 marks for more than 90% attendance. Defaulters are made to attend lectures during the preparatory leave period until their balance is compensated. So don’t you think you’ll get away with low attendance out here.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the strict norms of attendance you need to attend the assembly daily at 8.30am. Reminds of school isn't it?</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Not at all bad though it might take some getting used-to if you're from proper Mumbai. This is probably because most students are from Navi Mumbai itself. Their thinking and way of life is a bit different (that, in no way, means that it's bad). Mumbaikars may feel a bit uncomfortable surrounded by so many of them all the time. Most of them are sincere and studious. If you are not one, you might have tough times. Many Catholic students can be expected as there is a religious minority quota from year 2013-14.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Food is average and moderately cheap at Fr. Agnel Institute of Technology's canteen. Modern ventilation techniques have been installed, but the are of no help during peak hours. It is so hot that you could die of suffocation. A good variety of food is available including soups. There are some students who rely on canteen everyday.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing except the local road-side food stalls are available at walking distance near Fr. Agnel Institute of Technology. Other places can be accessed in a rick. You get delicious food in Shalimar (try the butter chicken) and Chenab. Huge malls - Raghuleela, Center One, Inorbit - and their food courts are a good option to pass away your time. Inorbit mall also offers games like laser tag. You can catch the latest movie at Raghuleela or Cinemax - Palm Beach Galleria. A drive on the palm beach road is an excellent and refreshing option if can get your car to college. Ramdev restaurant is also among favourites. However, the main issue would be to find suitable company who would be willing to bunk.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT), Vashi hosts an annual inter college festival in the even semester called 'n-Max CRITeria', which comprises a series of technical and non technical workshops, an intra-college cultural and sports festival called 'FACES' held in the odd semesters. The college also takes great pride in allowing its students, time for activities only after 4:30 PM, after which most establishments and colleges are closed. This turns students into a lot of burden carrying zombies who seem to have no fun at all. Strange-but-true : college has made it compulsory to attend the cultural fest!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT),<br> Agnel Technical Education Complex<br> Sector 9-A, Vashi,&nbsp;Navi Mumbai - 400703.<br> Phone : (022) 41611000, 27661924, 27660618.<br> Website: <a href="http://www.fcrit.ac.in/" target="_blank">www.fcrit.ac.in</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr CRIT is hated by many in the student community for its strict disciplinary principles &amp; its focus on ethics. There is little for college life and enjoyment here. Owing to its great faculty, nice infra &amp; decent placements, it is among top 10 in Mumbai.</p>	</section>
