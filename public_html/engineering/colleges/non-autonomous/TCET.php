					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET), Kandivali</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) is located in the beautiful Thakur Village which is 15-20 minutes by rickshaw from Kandivli station (W. Rly.) Students usually prefer to go by bus because it’s quite far from the station and hence rickshaw becomes a bit expensive for daily commuting.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) has excellent Infrastructure. One of the best in town. Huge campus. You can see the pictures of the college and read its own description about its infrastructure on its official website. And you might happen to spot celebrities if you stay after the college timings, as a lot of television ad film shootings take place in the campus, so you can now imagine how good the location and the infrastructure would be.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.E. Fee: Rs. 1,27,938/- year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.E. Fee: Rs. 1,32,093/- year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Accenture and Syntel are the major recruiters at Thakur College of Engineering. Average salary must be around Rs. 2.5 lac/year. Placement records over the last few years have been close to 100%.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Average faculty. Teachers take the pains to teach and students understand what they are taught as well. The teachers are very helpful. Somehow, the EXTC department students aren't very fond of the teachers and their teaching. They've loads to complain about them. Fortunately, Computers and IT department students have lauding words for their professors.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) is very strict in attendance matters. Minimum requirement is 60%. Students lingering around at Thakur Cinema if caught are sent to classrooms forcefully, of course that's only during college hours.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A mix breed of crowd - fun loving as well as nerds - students blend well though. Entertaining, decent and fun-to-have life. Majority are, however, not much interested in studies though the scene is changing since a few years. Being located in the western suburbs, students from locations like Navi Mumbai and Central/Harbour Mumbai aren't particularly keen about joining Thakur College is big numbers.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Excellent canteen. Very roomy but gets completely occupied as it is shared by students of all the faculties. Great food nevertheless. Students especially love the seating arrangement that has been done very thoughtfully and typical lounge style chairs have been provided.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Pizza Hut, CCD, Colassa (Hukkah Joint/Chinese Food), Monarch Restaurant, Jumbo King Vada Pav are all close to Thakur College of Engineering &amp; Technology (TCET). Dominos, Nirvana and some excellent hangouts in Kandivali Lokhandwala are also very famous. Thakur Cinema and Kulraj Broadway is the place where you'll find most of the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) celebrates Zephyr (Technical Festival) in odd semesters, Sojourn (Cultural Festival) in even semesters. They also have a Sports Festival. Great atmosphere during the festivals. Students have a gala time.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Location and infrastructure adds charm to Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET). The faculty is good yet the students here aren’t so keen on studying. So, a mixed reaction for this college.</p>	</section>
