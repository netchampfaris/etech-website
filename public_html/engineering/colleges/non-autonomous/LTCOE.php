					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCoE), Koparkhairane</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) is located a cool 5 minutes walk from the brilliantly named Koparkhairane railway station on the trans-harbour route.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This is probably the college’s USP. Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) has a really good infrastructure, with well maintained classrooms and, more importantly, washrooms. The labs are clean and well-equipped too. To top it all, they have a Massive campus, with basketball and badminton courts, a full-size football ground and other indoor sports like table tennis and carrom. However, lots of parts of the campus are still under construction and students face a plethora of problems currently.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">BTech Fee: Rs. 1,24,000/-year<br> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">It might seem a bit steep for a college in the middle of nowhere, but the infrastructure probably makes it worth it.</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">MTech Fee: Rs. 95,000/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>In 2010 there were 26 companies visiting the campus and placing approx. 166 students.</p>
					<p>2009 was a bad year, with almost NO placements, but otherwise about 75% of people do get placed comfortably. Larsen and Toubro is one of the major hirers. Average salary is about 3 lac p.a.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Another plus point. The faculty at Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering is experienced and quite qualified. They could probably give you a couple of KT’s if you get into their bad books, but that’s the case in most places. The mechanical faculty is supposed to be excellent, but the telecom faculty seems to have really deteriorated and is said to be pretty awful now.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">They’re a bit strict here. A letter is sent to parents if your attendance falls short of 75%. There have also been extreme cases where students having below 25% have been detained.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Like most colleges in the outskirts, Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) doesn’t exactly attract the best crowd. While its not bad, the majority of people come from Vashi, Thane and Koparkhairane. It’s a fairly mixed crowd though. Acceptable.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The food is not bad. Its sufficiently hot and most things are edible. Hygiene isn’t great, but that really shouldn’t be of much concern for engineering students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">In a word, none.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The cultural festival of Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering, 'Zephyr', is hosted sometime in March, and the technical festival 'Techzephyr' is hosted around September.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE)<br> Sector 4, Vikas Nagar, Koparkhairane,<br> Navi Mumbai-400 709.<br> Telephone nos : (022) 27541005, 27541006, 27547787<br> Website : <a href="http://www.ltce.ltjss.net/" target="_blank">www.ltce.ltjss.net</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">An amazing infrastructure does not make an amazing college.</p>	</section>
