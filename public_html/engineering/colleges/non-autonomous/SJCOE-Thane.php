					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shivajirao S Jondhale College of Engineering (SSJCOE), Dombivali</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Shivajirao Jondhale College Of Engineering is situated on Kalyan Shilphata road. You can reach the college by central railway trains. Dombivali is the nearest station, which is 4 km away. You can travel this distance by sharing auto-rickshaws. They charge you Rs.15/- for the ride, and they’re available only at the time when college starts and finishes. Kalyan-Dombivali Municipal Transport (KDMT) bus no. 55 also run from Dombivali staion, but it drops you 1km far from college. Bus fare is Rs.5/-.&nbsp;<br> From Kalyan Station the college is 6km away. A 6 seater auto charges Rs.10/- and drops you on the highway, about half a kilometer from the college, which takes some 8 minutes while walking. Its little inconvenient but not difficult getting to the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The campus is spread over 17 acres, with three inter-connected buildings. Middle building is for office purpose, with new interiors. All computer labs are well equipped, but mechanical &amp; chemical labs are in poor condition. Air conditioned Seminar hall is newly built but it is rarely used.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">No Hostel facility, instead students manage to share rooms in MIDC colony or nearby. Seniors help to get rooms if you ask.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 86,100/- year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">HOD’s are highly qualified and have a thorough knowledge of the subjects. The major cause of worry are the temporary staff, who are fresher and trying their hand at teaching. Most of the lecturers are just BE pass-outs and are doing their masters now. Internal marks depend upon your conduct and your rapport with the teachers. Most of the faculties teach in Hindi, Marathi and English. So vernacular medium students have no complains.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">In Shivajirao Jonndhale College of engineering, attendance is not that big an issue. But it depends solely upon Principal’s &amp; HOD’s mood. Temporary teachers are not that strict about attendance. If you appear in defaulter list, they ask for a letter from your Parents. In extreme cases parent are called to the college to meet HOD.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the crowd is from Dombivali and they like to call themselves ‘Dombivalikar’. While there are others who travel from various places ranging from Khopoli to Virar. There are some outside university students who are from Jalgaon. Most people come from a middleclass background and some students complain of girls not being fashion savvy. Local Political interference is less in Students council, compared to other colleges of this area. Ragging is strictly prohibited. Seniors are very supportive. There are no reservations or quotas.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no nearby hangouts. Instead students prefer to play football or cricket in the college ground. If you love indoor sports, there’s a gymkhana where you can amuse yourself by playing pool, carrom &amp; chess. Goga Pure Veg is only other option than canteen to eat outside college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Canteen is just about average, with availability of some cheap, edible food. Don’t expect variety of foods. There’s also a mess for Hostel students, but it is too far from the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festival :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Odyssey is the College’s annual cultural festival. Tech-fest also takes place in odd semesters.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Placement is a very disappointing department of Shivajirao Jondhale college. Placement cell is there but it is as good as non-existent. There are no on-campus placements as such, but college arranges group campus with other colleges. College also helps students in developing soft skills by arranging some seminars.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, if you stay in central suburbs and have a below average score, you can expect to join Shivajirao Jondhale College of Engineering. The location, placements and the crowd gives it a thumbs down!</p>	</section>
