					<h2>Vishwatmak Om Gurudev College of Engineering&nbsp;(VOGCOE), Atgaon, Shahpur</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Vishwatmak Om Gurudev College of Engineering (VOGCOE) is located in Shahpur (Thane District) near a village called ATGAON. It is close to Tansa Dam surrounded by green and serene atmosphere. Nearest local railway station is Asangaon on CST – Kasara line of central railways. Reaching college is a very challenging task. Train frequency is horrible and you must learn central rail timetables by heart in order to not miss the desired train. It is furhter 15 kms away from the station taking around 30 minutes to reach by college buses or by shared taxi. Due to this many students prefer staying in hostels or in rented apartments nearby.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">VOGCOE has a large campus with lots of open space and a big garden. There are separate buildings for each year of engineering. As these buildings are newly constructed, they are in good condition and all the academic requirements such as well equipped labs, modern well stocked library, seminar room, classrooms etc are very well taken care of. The classrooms, though not air-conditioned, are spacious and well-ventilated and have a nice lush green view. Playgrounds and sports facilities are also up-to-the mark. However, there is one complain common among students, which is about not having internet connectivity within the campus.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There is provision of separate hostel for boys and girls within the college premises. Hostel rules are very stringent. “If you opt for hostel you have to get up at 4:30am for meditation”, complains a student – jokingly or not – we do not know. Wi-fi connectivity is not there in hostels either. “Once you enter the college your connection with outside world is cut”, laments another referring to this problem. Hostel facilities are also not at all up to the mark and no action is taken to improve it inspite of repeated compaints. Many students have left the hostels midway and opted staying on rented aprtments nearby.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Approximately Rs 63,000 per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Faculties have improved a lot since the inception of the college. Most of the faculties are experienced. They are very cooperative and open to any number of doubts. One notable thing about many of the faculties is that they are very spiritual. They wish morning by saying "Om Gurudev" and expect you to wish back with an “Om gurudev”!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is taken quite seriously in this college. Faculty keeps lecturing and warning about the consequences that’ll have to be faced if attendance is low. They often repeat these words "attendance and discipline are the first motto of college", says a student. Those featuring in defaulters' list (attendance less than 75%) might have to donate a few books to the library.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A major chunk of crowd comes from the central line, especially from nearby areas like Shahpur and Vada. Also quite a few nerds can be found here. Some of them don’t leave their books even during breaks and find solace in solving math problems rather than socializing. And finally girls are greatly outnumbered by boys. So overall it’s a kind of dull crowd.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Every Thursday students are supposed to attend a compulsory meditation and spiritual session, for which you should be dressed in white shirt and blue jean pants.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very few things like Vada Pav, Cutlet, Bhaji Pav etc. are served at the canteen of Om Gurudev College of Engineering. No other options to have food nearby owing to which most students bring food from their home. There is just one small shop where you get toffies, candies and such stuff. Students don't like the current canteen much and demand an improvement.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately there is hardly any decent place to hang-out around the college. Till horizon you will see farms, bullocks, tractors, plough etc etc etc. Those fond of exploring can visit Tansa Dam and Tansa Abhayaranya which are just about 5 minutes from college. There's also a place called "Hidden Village" about 8 km from the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A tech fest called Ikran, a cultural fest and a sports festivals are arranged at Om Gurudev College of Engineering.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As the college was established in 2011, first batch is yet to pass-out. Nothing can be said about the placement till then.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It's difficult to judge a college at an early stage. Lots of things needs to be improved - mainly the faculty, canteen and hostel. Even after improvements will be done, the location will be a main hindrance for any student.</p>	</section>
