					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shivajirao Jondhale College of Engineering and Technology, Asangaon</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Shivajirao Jondhale College of Engineering and Technology is located in Shahapur&nbsp; and is a 15-20 minute walk from Asangaon Railway Stn (CST-Kasara route, Central Rly). Another option is to go by rick which costs you about Rs. 7 per seat.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college is newly established and the infrastructure is still under construction. The campus is huge and is shared by other sister organisations most of which are still coming up. The classrooms are clean and the Labs are air-conditioned. However, there is no hostel in the campus.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 86,100/- per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The students do not seem to be happy with the faculty. “The professors think too high of themselves” says one student. They tend to take personal revenge on your marks if you happen to be disliked by them.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very lenient. If you manage to keep it above 30%, it would just be enough. Even if you can’t its something to worry, because you will just be given some extra assignments. If you are very unfortunate your parents may be called for.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Majority is from Dombivali, Kalyan, Thane and other central suburbs. A few students do take the courage to come from Western suburbs. The crowd is quite chilled-out and fun to be with.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NOTHING. Closest civilisation would be the Railway station or the Shahapur town. But nothing exceptional can be found there as well, so head right home.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Food quality is not up-to-the-mark and the lack of space in the canteen makes you keep out of the canteen premises even more. There is nothing else nearby as well so get your “<em>dabba”</em> with home-cooked food if do not wish to stay hungry.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The first batch passed out with a few placements. However, the students aren't really satisfied and most have to look for jobs off campus.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Shivajirao Jondhale College of Engineering and Technology,<br>Asangaon, Tal Shahapur, Opp Railway station,<br>Dist : Thane – 421601<br>Phone : 02527-273999<br>Website: <a href="http://www.jondhleengg.com" target="_blank">www.jondhleengg.com</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many other better colleges. Avoid coming here, unless you have no other options.</p>	</section>
