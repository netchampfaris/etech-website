					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">GV Acharya Institute of Engineering and Technology, Shelu</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">GV Acharya Institute of Engineering and Technology is located near Shelu Railway station (CST-Karjat route, Central Rly). While it takes 15 minutes to walk from the station if you take the cemented road, it's less 10 mins if you go by the “short-cut” which goes right through the farms. So not a mean task, that is, once you get to Shelu railway station!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">GV Acharya Institute of Engineering and Technology was establised in 2009. The large campus houses a polytechnic and a management institute apart from the engineering college. While most of the contsruction is complete, a few parts still need a little finishing. However, the labs are well-designed and carry sufficient equipments. The library is awesome. Hostel facility is available but it is located in Neral.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 60,000/ year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very good faculty. Many professors are from Vidyalankar, the famous coaching classes. All the teachers are very co-operative. The students are fond of the principal who is surprisingly very friendly.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very strict. You have maintain a 90% record if you wish to score well in your internal marks. If the attendance goes below 75% the students are given strict warnings and are made sign a document stating the he/she will improve his attendance in the next semester. There’s no mercy for those having below 50% attendance and are detained straight-away.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">About 10% of the students come from nearby local areas. Whereas the others are from Mumbai-city or Central suburbs.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NONE.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Food quality is okay but space crunch during lunch hours is an issue. Fried rice is the most preferred variety among the students and it costs about Rs. 30/-.&nbsp;Some of the students have complained about the quality of food citing an example of coffee which is almost water.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The first batch passed out in 2013. However, no data is available yet.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
