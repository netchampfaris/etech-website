					<h2>Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering - Fr CRCE (Fr. Agnel College of Engineering), Bandra</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Bandstand, mate. You have a breathtaking view of the sea from the classrooms &nbsp;and a cool breeze is constantly blowing. A 15 - 20 minute ride in a rickshaw should take you to Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (better known as Fr. Agnel College of Engineering) from Bandra railway station (Western Railway &amp; Harbour Railway) but that would be a bit expensive. BEST bus 211 starts from Bandra station and drops you right outside the college gate which happens to be the last stop. Having said that, the frequency is simply superb.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A school, a chapel and the college building are in the same premises of Fr. Agnel College of Engineering. The diploma and degree classes are in the same building. It houses lecture halls, well-equipped laboratories of all departments, computer centres, a capacious library with many books and journals, dedicated internet centre for students, gymnasium, auditorium, canteen and other imperative amenities. Gymkhana is common for all and it is crowded most of the times. The campus is Wifi Enabled and the students are provided with specialized barcoded ID cards to avail the required amenities. Excellent computational facility with 3 MBps internet connectivity. Hostel facilities are available, but only for boys.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.E Fee: Rs. 85,000/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.E Fee: Rs. 92,240/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering placement records have always been gratifying with more than 100% placement every year. All renowned companies come here. TCS, Infosys, Amdocs, L&amp;T Infotech pick up maximum students with salaries ranging between Rs. 2.5 lacs p.a. to Rs. 4 lacs p.a. In recent years, placements have picked up even more, with some more dream companies like Google, IBM, Hewlett Packard, JP Morgan, Nerolac coming in and offering better packages. Expect the trend to continue.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering has hired a lot of new faculty. The old professors are quite good in the sense that they do teach and students can understand if they attend. Some students find the teaching pretty okay in the Computer dept. while the Production dept. seems very strict. Few of the faculty members are helpful and open to doubts.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance at Fr CRCE is quite strict. It has to be maintained above 75% no matter what. No grace attendance given even for students participating extra-curricular. Every week attendance is checked. If the weekly attendance is less than 75% then the student wonâ€™t be allowed to attend the lab sessions. Long procedure to be followed if name appears in defaulters. Parents are called and lengthy assignments are given as punishment. It is not a place to be in if you want to bunk too much! A lot of students even call it a JAIL.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowd is dominated by students fit to become rocket-scientists at Fr. Agnel College of Engineering. There is a Catholic minority quota from year 2013-14 hence the crowd is bound to be dominated by Catholic students. Life during college is quite restricted, though people manage to enjoy anyway. Boys to girls ratio is decent. Crowd is very jovial towards festivals and other extra curricular activities. Being a popular and reputed college in the island city, you're bound to meet students from different backgrounds and localities. Northern, Western suburbs followed by <em>townies </em>and some from the central suburbs and Navi Mumbai are seen here. Location plays a vital role in such a diversified college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It is quite congested, food is edible but not to suit the taste buds. It is often unhygienic and extremely oily. Students have tried to change it by writing many letters but all in vain. Most students prefer&nbsp;<em>dabba</em>&nbsp;they bring from their home over canteen.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Bandstand Promenade, CCD, Barista, Mocha, Taj Land's End (of course no one goes there), Yoko's, Natural's, Elco and all that you want in life; after-all it's Bandra, the coolest suburb of Mumbai. If you're tired of the Bandstand ambience then you always have Carter Road where there are ample &nbsp;joints from popular food brands. Oh, and the crowd is simply to die for! Last but not the least, Bandra Fort is&nbsp; perfect for those in relationship &amp; in search for some privacy!&nbsp;However, CRCE being a strict college, students normally have to sacrifice these beautiful hangout places.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">"Euphoria" is the cultural festival of Fr. Agnel College of Engineering held in even semesters and "Crescendo" is the technical fest held in odd semesters. The college is not very supportive for the fests which disappoints students and they lose interest in conducting them. Hence little participation is seen in the fests.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering<br> Fr Agnel Ashram, Bandstand, Bandra(W),<br> Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. 400 050.<br> Tel:91-22-26423841/842/004 ;&nbsp;Fax:91-22-6516831<br> Website : <a href="http://www.frcrce.ac.in/" target="_blank">www.frcrce.ac.in</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Fr. Agnel College of Engineering is overall a good and a renowned college but some avoid it due to lack of freedom. In short, if you love your independence TOO much, you're at the wrong place. It's as strict as a school. Keeping the strictness aside, the college is worth every penny for the four wonderful years. One of the top colleges in city, it's an ideal choice for the top scorers.</p>	</section>
