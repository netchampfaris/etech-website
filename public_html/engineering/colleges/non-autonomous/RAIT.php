					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT), Nerul</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT) is very close to Nerul Railway Station &amp; Juinagar Railway Station (Harbour Rly) - Takes about 10 minutes by rickshaw.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">By Bus :&nbsp;By Dadar-Panvel S.T. bus get down at LP Nerul stop.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">By Bus no. 511, 512, 507, 506 get down at D. Y. Patil Bus stand.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">NMMT Bus No.44 From Dombivli and Bus No.24 From New Panvel also drop you close to the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT) is housed in a spacious building, part of the huge DY Patil Campus which is home to many other sister institutes. Most of the canteens and faculties are connected internally and there is considerable interaction among people from different faculties. There are close to half a dozen labs (And we mean well maintained ones!). Even though the college is situated in the DY Patil Deemed University campus it is affiliated to University of Mumbai.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.E. Fee: Rs. 80,000/ year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.E. Fee: Rs. 55,000/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>Records are good and average salary offered was around Rs. 3.25 lac p.a. for the previous year. The major recruiter is Infosys. Great progress has been made in the recent years and students claim that RAIT placements are now at par with the best colleges in Mumbai.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">RAIT has some really dedicated professors. Over the last few years, the standard of the college has increased tremendously and thus excellent teaching staff have been employed in this college. There are some okay teachers. Communication takes place in English. Teachers are not very strict; but at the same time they're not into favourtism. That's about it.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A masala mix of scholars, cyber junkies, diehard headbangers, take-it-easy goers, flunkers, Martians, Gujjus etc. can be found at Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Life in RAIT begins at 9:00 AM and seems to end at 6:00 PM (People never leave, they seem to fade away. RAIT is never lifeless). People are into Computers, rock music...rock music and computers. Half of RAIT comprises cyber nuts the other half sleep on guitars.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Strangely enough RAIT canteen (managed by Anna) serves good food at very reasonable rates. Thali, Vada Pav, Masala Dosa are favourites. The ambience has been recently upgraded and now attracts students from every department be it medicine or law and of course engineering. The change has been so drastic that alumni who haven't been to their college for long, can't believe it's the same canteen.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The basement is the site of all underground and nefarious activities. It houses the engineering canteen and the medical canteen. (Medical? Well the engineering &amp; medical colleges are in the same building &amp; engineering guys share a special relationship with the medicals)&nbsp;<br> Off campus: Dosa Plaza, Rangoli, CCD, Domino's and the DY Patil stadium.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">"Kalaraag" is RAIT's cultural fest that is purely dedicated to performing arts and English, Hindi and prominently Marathi theatre. HORIZON - the inter-college fest. Niyantran, TECHKNOW, TECHMATE, Whizion are other festivals.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT) is not monotonously boring. In fact it is daringly different. A healthy mix of both education and entertainment. So if you plan to be an engineer with a difference then RAIT is the place to be in.</p>	</section>
