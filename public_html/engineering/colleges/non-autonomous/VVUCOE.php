					<h2>Universal College of Engienering (UCoE), Kaman, Vasai</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Vidya Vikas Education Trust's Technical Campus (VVETTC) is situated by the NH4, about 3 kms from nearest railway station of Kaman Road on Diva-Vasai railway line. Located in this campus is Universal College of Engineering (UCoE), having beautiful surrounding with a forest cover on all sides. Kaman river flows right next to college campus. The surrounding area is quiet, peaceful and serene with little civilization to be found. As the college is situated on the out skirts of the city, travelling is a major problem. The college has organized a chargeable bus pickup facility from Vasai, Thane and Borivali for students and teachers.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The campus is huge, especially when compared to colleges within the city. Since the college is just two years old, the infrastructure is modern and well appreciated by the students. The building is well designed but some parts of the building are still under construction. The laboratories and class rooms are well spaced and well equipped. All the instruments are hi-tech which match the current standards. The library is well stocked with all popular books in every field. The college does not have a proper play ground but there are many open spaces nearby where students are normally found playing cricket.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs 65,000/- per year;&nbsp;And adding to that&nbsp;Rs 16,000 – Rs 18,000/- per year as bus fees.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Students don't find the faculty at Vidya Vikas Universal College of Engineering up to the mark. Most of them are average teachers and not really liked by the students. Although the professors are extremely helpful and student friendly, the lack of knowledge about their respective subjects is what concerns the students and parent alike. "Math and Physics departments needs to be improved", says one of the students. "One will definitely have to join some classes for better understanding of the subject", says another.</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><br> Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance at Universal College of engineering is not a big problem. Minimum 75% attendance is required as per university norms, but even if it falls below, the students are let off with a warning.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Canteen called 'Literati cafe' is pretty good and spacious at Universal College which is naturally liked by the students. Almost everything ranging from Pastas, sandwiches to Pav bhaji is obtained here. The food here is served at a nominal price with an adequate amount of quantity. A light background music is also said to be played here.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowd at Universal College of engineering is pretty decent. More number of Guajaratis are found because of 51% linguistic minority quota. Most of the students are from the nearby areas.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Not much of option for hangouts, as the college is located on the Highway (NH4). There are absolutely no restaurants and shops nearby. The nearest snack shop is at Kaman Station about 3km away from the college. So the students prefer the canteen only. Once in a while you can go to the famous Bhajanson's Dairy farms and Kaman Durg (fort).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As the college is new, there was only one festival held where various artists were called to perform. This festival was not liked by the students.</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As the college is established in 2012, there is some time to go for the placements updates.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Vidya Vikas Education Trust's Technical Campus (VVTTEC)<br> Universal College of Engineering (UCoE)<br> Survey Number 146 (part),&nbsp;Village Kaman<br> Kaman Bhivandi Road (Maharashtra State Highway 4)<br> Taluka Vasai,&nbsp;Thane 401212<br> Phone: +91 8007000755,&nbsp;0250-6962458<br> Email: engineering@universal.edu.in<br> Website:&nbsp;<a href="http://universalcollegeofengineering.edu.in/" target="_blank">http://universalcollegeofengineering.edu.in</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a new college, Universal College of Engineering is not reputed. Yet students seem to be satisfied with the way it has come up and have no major comlaints apart from the faculties, which the college needs to improve. It’s a decent option for students residing in the nearby area who could not make it to more reputed and older colleges.</p>	</section>
