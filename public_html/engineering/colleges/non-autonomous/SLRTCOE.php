					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shree L.R. Tiwari College of Engineering, Mira Road</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Located in far northern Mumbai suburb, Shree L.R. Tiwari College of Engineering is one of the new engineering institutes in the city. The college is situated in Mira Road east and Mira Road is the nearest railway station which is about 20 minutes from the college. It is accessible by state transport buses and share auto rickshaws. Though the location is pretty aloof, accessibility to the college is not that cumbersome though one needs to be EXTREMELY patient for the slow government bus services.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The road to the white tall building LR Tiwari Engineering College is under construction. Moreover, it’s pretty bad and dusty.&nbsp;The infrastructure is decent enough. As the college is newly constructed, it has modern infrastructure with all amenities. The labs are well&nbsp;&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;and classrooms are well ventilated. Classrooms are spacious and benches are comfortable. All the laboratories are air conditioned. Library has plenty of books.&nbsp;Washrooms, most of the time, are clean. The college is enabled with a wifi connection though often there are restrictions to use it.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs.&nbsp;78,750/- per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As it’s a new college in the city, the faculty certainly is not renowned. The college has a mix of both experienced and newly hired staff. Many of the teachers have a few years of industrial experience. Students, definitely, demand a good lot of faculty but most have got the <em>‘chalta hai’ </em>attitude. Though some of the teachers are helpful and patient enough, the students here prefer to study on their own. Lectures are conducted in English and Hindi depending upon the professors and the set of students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Students say that 75% is compulsory and LR Tiwari follows it religiously. Falling short of attendance will cost you loads of assignment work and sometimes fine (yeah, monetary fine). For terribly low attendance, parents are called. It’s advised to attend lectures regularly unless you share an excellent rapport with the respective teacher. However,&nbsp;there has never been a case of detainment or year back due to attendance.&nbsp;Moderately strict college as far as attendance is considered.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the students in LR Tiwari are from the areas of Thane and far North Mumbai. Boy to girl ratio would be 5:1. One needs to accept the fact that majority of the crowd won’t be smart, intelligent in forming years of lower rung colleges. There are many North Indians due to Hindi linguistic minority quota in place. Despite being&nbsp; a new college, you can expect a good healthy unity among the crowd. College festivals, though not on a huge scale, are celebrated every year and students participate in good numbers.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The terribly bad location is a big turn off when it comes to hangouts. Restaurants like CCD, Pizza Hut and Chilliza have opened up recently and there is also your hot favourite McDonald’s which is at a mere 15 minutes walking distance. The roadside foodstalls, farsan shops and a few restaurants just outside Mira Road station are generally the hotspot destination for LR Tiwari-ites.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Utsav, the technical cum cultural festival of Shree L.R.Tiwari College of Engineering, is celebrated in the even semester.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">No batch has yet passed, so nothing can be commented about placements as of now.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Shree L.R.

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly not the best in the city, not even close to the average league, Shree L.R. Tiwari College of Engineering certainly has a long way to climb and reach the pinnacle of engineering institutes. A good bet for a below average scorer. Also not at all a bad option for people staying nearby.</p>	</section>
