					<h2>KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE), Vidyavihar</h2>
					<hr>
					<p class="ja-typo-icon icon-message"><span class="icon">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>NOTE</em></span>:</strong> KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE), Vidyavihar is likely to declared as an <a href="/engineering-admissions?id=1270" target="_blank"><span style="color: #cc0000;">autonomous college</span></a> affiliated to Mumbai University from the year 2013-14.</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE), more popularly known as "KJ", is closest to Vidhyavihar railway station (C.Rly.), at a mere 10 minute walk. Bus stops towards South Mumbai &amp; Chembur (Harbour Rly.) are in proximity. However it is becomes extremely exhaustive for students travelling from western suburbs. Share rickshaw services from Vidyavihar station to the college has proved a boon to many students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure at KJ Somaiya is not very great but it's not bad either. The new building has certainly brought smiles to many students but most still feel that it is not very 'appealing'. The campus is huge, perhaps one of the biggest, but it is not well maintained. A huge ground which can be used for cricket &amp; football is available at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE). Laboratory equipments have been updated and modern facilities have been made available to the students. "All buildings in this campus could have been made extraordinary but the management seems least interested", says one of the students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 135000/year . Keeping the facilities and infrastructure in mind, the tuition fee is exorbitant.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Faculty :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Teaching is said to be 'unbearable' at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE). “Do not depend on them!” says one of the students. "Eventhough the college has a very good reputation in the city and has been always preferred by top scorers, the teaching department has never been promising", she continues. Lectures are certainly conducted in English and most of the professors are M.Tech/PhD holders but striking a chord with the students has always been a problem here.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the students of KJ Somaiya, the management is little soft on defaulters. Assignment punishments are given if attendance is below 60 % (at least in the 1st&nbsp; year) but most copy (nothing new) and escape the punishment. The college has never made any harsh decision by not allowing students to sit for the exam or asked for a fine.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a <em>gujju</em> (Gujarati minority)&nbsp;college, 50% of the seats are reserved for Gujaratis though you always see more than 75% of Gujjus in this college.&nbsp;As per engineering standards the crowd is good enough at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE). You’ll find all kinds of people here,&nbsp; from nerds to the so called “kewl ppl” and also the smart lot. Even the gunda variety is said to be found here. Fortunately, over the last couple of years, the crowd has been good and you really meet a lot of urban people.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen is pretty good. Food is delicious and the rates are also reasonable. The canteen space is less, so you will find it jam-packed most of the times. People from other junior colleges are found more in the canteen than the engineering crowd. Food items of all types are available.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">McDonald’s, Sam's Pizza, Cream Centre, Fame &amp; Cinemax Adlabs are some of the most visited hagnouts by KJ Somaiya students. Coffee lovers can sip coffee and munch donuts with their loved ones at CCD. That’s about it!&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE) celebrates the following festivals : Abhiyantriki (technical festival) held in October and Symphony (Cultural Festival) is held in January. Orion Racing India is an international racing team of enthusiastic engineers from KJ, determined to get the most out of their educational experience. Through passion and commitment, students collaborate as a team to design, build, test and race an open-wheeled formula style race car that competes in the annual Formula SAE competition. Having developed three such cars (Barracuda600, Itanta and Stallion) the team is presently working on their fourth and their most advanced machine.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Students take admission here because of the placements. Placements at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE) are good and have a track record of placing at least 70% students. Comps and IT being at the top. 95% of the companies are software based companies. Though the average salary is same as any other engineering college that is 2, 50,000/-pa, the highest salary was 9.5 Lakh.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE)<br> Vidyanagar, Vidyavihar(E),<br> Mumbai - 400 077.<br> Phone 91-22-66449191<br> Fax : 91-22-25152272<br> Website : <a href="http://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce/" target="_blank">www.somaiya.edu/kjsce</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, KJSCE is a very good college and should be amongst the top choices of a student, if s/he resides in this part of Mumbai. For others, travelling becomes a disadvantage. A good bet for an average scorer. While placements is one of the strong plus points of this college; average infrastructure and faculty has been a perrenial problem. With its recent autonomous status, KJ Somaiya will surely strive hard to become one of the top engineering colleges in Mumbai.</p>	</section>
