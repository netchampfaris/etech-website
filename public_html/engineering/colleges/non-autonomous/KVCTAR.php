					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Smt. Alamuri Ratnamala Institute of Engineering and Technology (ARMIET), Sapgaon run by&nbsp;Koti Vidya Charitable Trust</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Alamuri Ratnamala Institute of Engineering and Technology (ARMIET), run by Koti Vidya Charitable Trust is located in Sapgaon about 6 kms from Asangaon Railway Stn (CST-Kasara route, Central Rly). The college provides a bus facility in accordance with local train timings and many students travel in them. Charges fort this facility are Rs 6000 per annum but they may be dropped from coming academic year, as more and more students are opting for it. There are also ST buses in case you miss the college bus. It takes about 35-40 mins to reach the college by ST bus and about 15-20 mins if you come by your private vehicle.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college is newly established (in the year 2008) and the infrastructure is excellent. The entire campus has internet accessibility through wi-fi. Labs are well-equipped, clean and air-conditioned. There are many computers at students' disposal; all in good condition. Library has volumes of books. Students beware of CCTV cameras!!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">One major complain is that Electricity goes down frequently in the area. However, college has made provision for that by installing high capapcity generators and full UPS backup for entire college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 72,000/ year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">ARMIET has improved a lot of their faculties from when it started. There is a healthy teacher-to-student ratio and many of the faculties are qualified from reputed colleges. If the students are not happy with a particular faculty, college brings in external faculty for that subject. Some of them are from even the IITs &amp; NITs. Hardly any student from ARMIET have to take extra coaching or tutions.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">If you manage to keep it above 70%, it would just be enough. Even if you can’t it’s not something to worry, because you will just be given some extra assignments or you'll be required to attend extra lectures. However, if your parents are particular about this, you may be in trouble because a daily record of your attendance is sent via SMS to your parents. Some teachers are very strict about it and they'll make you attend all the lectures.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Majority of crowd is from central suburbs of Dombivali, Kalyan, Thane, Mulund &amp; Kurla and a few from South Mumbai. A few students do take the courage to come from Western suburbs. The crowd is quite chilled-out and fun to be with. Hardly a few students are studious and very few nerdy. Very co-operative seniors.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college is right in the middle of farms and a there's a river passing by. Nothing else can be found nearby. Students prefer travelling to Titwala or Khadavli for some recreation. One Harshigiri resort is nearby (4-5 kms). Recently Dominos, KFC and Kamath have opened up near college on the Highway.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Canteen of ARMIET is separate from main academic building and it is spacious serving quality food. Food is priced nominally.&nbsp;There's an RO plant feeding mineral water to all coolers of the college and the college management is proud of this plant.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">ARMIET celebrates its Technical festival Techfiesta in March. It is an inter college festival. There is also a kind of unique festival 'Mathru Devo Bhava' held on Mother's Day. Other events include fresher's party and convocation.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Placements for the first batch were not that great but they picked up from 2nd batch onwards. College is trying its best to bring in many companies for recruitment. They are also providing pre-placement industrial taining and help in grooming of the student too. The salaries ranged from 1.8 to 3.6 Lakh per annum.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">College is not bad when it comes to academics but you need to decide for yourself if you can travel so much or not.</p>	</section>
