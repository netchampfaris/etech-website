					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT), Kurla</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT) is located at the Don Bosco, Kurla campus in front of the Kohinoor City which is the office destination of many corporate bigwigs like NSE. The Bandra-Kurla Complex is at 5 minutes drive from the DBIT Campus. The nearest railway station is Vidyavihar (C.Rly.) about a 10 minute walk.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a direct bus service from Santacruz (W.Rly.) to Vidyavihar (Bus No. 433). The nearest bus junction is Kamani, which is networked through the BEST buses to Andheri, Ghatkopar, Mulund and other places.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The classrooms are roomy and well ventilated. There is ample natural light pouring in courtesy of the large windows. The labs are modern and well equipped. Elements of contemporary design can be seen everywhere. There is a chapel on the ground floor.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a huge football ground, basketball court and it is concretised. There are provisions for indoor games like carrom&nbsp; and table tennis at Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT). The campus has lush greenery throughout the year. Even the insides of the buildings are spruced up by placing potted plants. Recent changes have been to the landscape, by addition of a lawn at the upper echelons which double up as a playground and reception venue.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">DBIT is a private-unaided institute</p>
					<ul style="text-align: justify;">
						<li>Rs. 115,500/-year for general category</li>
						<li>Rs. 57,750/-year for OBCs</li>
						<li>Rs. <span style="color: #000000;">13,256/-year for NT</span></li>
						<li>No tuition fee for SC/ST category</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Faculty at Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT) is average with mechanical being the best since most of the professors are good. Other departments have one or two excellent professors and one or two are said to be really horrible ones.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite strict on this front. 60% attendance is recommended. Parents are called to meet the teachers and extra assignments are given to the defaulters.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a 50% quota for Roman Catholics. Mixed crowd in terms of fun-lovers and book-lovers.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen at Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT) is big enough and roomy. The food is pretty cheap but vegetarian food tastes bad and should be avoided under all circumstances. Veggie lovers, home food is the way to go here!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There have been new malls which have come up in the vicinity which houses many franchisee outlets with the likes of KFC, MOD and McDonalds here, so enough places to hangout here. These malls have come as a big relief to students who earlier had no option but go to Ghatkopar or Chembur.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The annual cultural festival of the college is called as "CreXtal" which stands for Creativity, Excellence and Talent. The inter-college technical festival organized by the college is called "Colosseum". However from 2009, "Colosseum" will be an intra-college festival. The college will be divided into 3 different houses where students will compete against each other representing their house. The winning house gets the DBIT Shield.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Accenture, Infosys, L&amp;T InfoTech and Hexaware. About 70% of the students generally fall under the "eligiblity criteria" which is usually a requirement of 60% marks or higher. Most of the eligible candidates are placed.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Average salaries offered would be around Rs. 3 lac p.a.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Above average rating could be given to Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT). Definitely shouldn't be on the mind of the toppers though. If your score lies between the toppers and average scorers, you can consider this institute, keeping in mind its location which is more favourable to students residing in the eastern suburbs than the western suburbs.</p>	</section>
