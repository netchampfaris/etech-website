					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Mahatma Gandhi Mission's College of Engineering and Technology (MGMCET), Kalamboli</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It takes 10 mins in rickshaw to reach Mahatma Gandhi Mission's College of Engineering and Technology (MGMCET) from Khandeshwar Railway station on Harbour Rly. (costs around Rs. 25). It is located near the start of the Mumbai-Pune expressway, real close to the McDonalds where you halt to have a snack while going to Lonavala.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">They say its probably not worth the price you are paying. Still, recently some improvement has been done. The labs are well-equipped and resourceful, class rooms are spacious. The campus is huge but doesn’t look lively. Infra is being improved but at a slow rate.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">BTech Fee: Rs. 85766/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">MTech Fee: Rs. 89921/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>80% of the students at Mahatma Gandhi Mission's College of Engineering and Technology get placement. The average package is Rs. 3 lac p.a.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the teachers are fresh graduates themselves. Some get pissed when doubts are asked, whereas some are chilled out. Biomedical branch has the best faculty. If you want some serious studying done, then this is not the place for you.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Students with exponentially decreasing attendance figures such as 30% to 3% to 0.3% have been found to get away easily. So no problems on this front. “Just produce a fake medical certificate and it’ll do the work for you”, says one of their student.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Majority of the students come from villages. 5% are&nbsp;said to be ‘impossible to last a conversation with’. Students say that you cannot possibly hangout with this crowd except if you fall into one of the above categories.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The food was not edible once upon a time. At the most, you could have Pepsi. “With anything else”, says a student, “you may have been risking your life.” However, things have changed now and the canteen is a much better place. Students love the canteen now.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">You will have to travel to Khargar or Belapur for spending some quality time with friends. There is a "tapri" outside college which is patronized by many students. Most of the students dont really travel, they prefer chilling on the campus itself.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The technical festival ‘Crysalis’ takes place in September. Cultural festival Arete comes around mid-March. Model rocketing is a novel event in the tech-fest of Mahatma Gandhi Mission's College of Engineering and Technology (MGMCET)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Mahatma Gandhi Mission's College of Engineering and Technology (MGMCET)<br> Junction NH-4, Sion Panvel Expressway,Navi Mumbai - 410 209<br> Tel No: 022-27423403/022-65138119<br> Website: <a href="http://www.mgmmumbai.ac.in/" target="_blank">www.mgmmumbai.ac.in</a></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay away if you want to live and have a life. The crowd is depressing and there are no pretty faces to give respite. Everything and everyone takes a lot of time in getting things done, especially anything which has some form filling.</p>	</section>
