					<h2>Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (RGIT), Versova, Mumbai</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3>Location:</h3>
					<p>Manjara Charitable Trust's Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (RGIT) is located near 7 bunglows, Versova. The nearest railway station is&nbsp;Andheri (W.Rly. &amp; Harbour Rly.). There are many &nbsp;BEST buses available from station for those who do not want to take a rickshaw everyday. The rickshaw ride might empty your pocket by a huge sum. The college does not have a very accessible location especially for those who travel by train.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p>RGIT's glass building which looks stunning at the first glance has a balcony/small terrace on every floor. &nbsp;The big green and well mainatined lawn right at the start of the entrance adds to the USP of the infrastructure.&nbsp;It has good quality labs and computers. The campus is also quite big compared to many other engineering colleges. &nbsp;The classrooms are very well ventilated. Library is very well equipped with dozens of same copy.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Fees:</h3>
					<p>Rs.&nbsp;125000/- per year</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Faculty:</h3>
					<p>Faculty at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (RGIT) in general is average. Some&nbsp; professors have no clue of the subject at all. There are a handful of professors who have requisite knowledge to be there teaching you. Students have accepted the <em>chalta hai</em> attitutde and thus the staff over the years has been the same and less bothered.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Attendance:</h3>
					<p>It&nbsp; is indeed one big problem that students face. Not 75% but a minimum of 55% is necessary. Be careful with your professors like in any other engineering college (<em>Panga mat lena</em> <em>bhaiyya</em>).</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Crowd:</h3>
					<p>Crowd here comes from a mixed background. Some come here through reservations, while some others being from rich families,&nbsp; pay their way into the college. The others who land up here are due to their scores in CET. Boys to girls ratio is the same like any other engineering college. Students from the Western and Northern suburbs and South Mumbai are mostly seen in this college. Due to its 'not-so-good' location, students from the Central and Harbour belt and Navi Mumbai tend to avoid this college.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Canteen:</h3>
					<p>RGIT has one of the very good canteens in Mumbai colleges. It is well ventilated and decently spaced. Various food items like Pav Bhaji, Chaat, South Indian and Pizza are the most preferred ones. Prcies are extremely moderate for the super quality food and thus it has always turned out to be a saviour for most of the studnets.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Hangouts:</h3>
					<p>Owing to it RGITs upmarket location, the college has some fantatic hangouts .Versova beach and 'Versova rocks' followed by Yari road are all very close to the college and will cost a minimum rickshaw fare to get you there. Eatery joints like Kareems and drinking joints like Pop Tates and Sodas have always attracted the students. Lokhandwala is another excellent hangout next to the college where you can expect almost everything under the sun. Movie buffs can look out for Fun Republic (also famous for its Bowling Alley) and Fame Cinemas at Citi Mall.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Festivals:</h3>
					<p>"Zodiac" is the main festival of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (RGIT) and it has various programs like rock concerts and gaming events. LAN gaming has been held in this festival regularly. The college hosts many inter-college events which is taken part of by many of the other engineering colleges in the area. This gives the opportunity to the students to mingle with students from other colleges. Various technical and cultural fests throughout the year are organized by the technical organizations, i.e. IEEE, CSA, ISA. Its great for sports and extra curriculars.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>Strictly okay except for 2010 when it showed 80-85% placements. Placements in the instrumentation branch are relatively bad. Some good companies do come to pick students from college but most students are culled and only a handful are placed. In 2009 about 130 students were placed in good companies. About 45% placements in 2007 and 60% in 2008. Infosys is the major taker. Placements are improving year on year, though, so it's worth the risk.</p>

					<h3>Verdict:</h3>
