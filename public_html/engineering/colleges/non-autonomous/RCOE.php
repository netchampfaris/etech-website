					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Rizvi College of Engineering, Bandra</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Very few colleges in Mumbai can beat the location of Rizvi College of Engineering. It's off the plush Carter road promenade and behind Pali Hill, home of many celebrities. One might often bump into a celebrity or someone popular. It's midway Khar (W.Rly) and Bandra (Harbour Rly)&nbsp;but really far from the respective stations. Taking a rickshaw &nbsp;to the college everyday might be a little expensive. BEST bus no. 220 from Khar or Bandra stations and 51 &amp; 56 from Dadar and Santacruz are the most preferred.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, we found this a little disappointing but certainly not the worse in Mumbai. The classrooms have 2 air conditioners each. The labs are less equipped with apparatus; some are faulty and some aren’t even there. There’s no college ground but there are lots of public grounds nearby for sports enthusiasts especially cricket which beats in every Rizvites heart. The toilets often stink; so it is advised that you finish off your stuff at home. The infrastructure is improving though.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 63745/- year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty :</h3>
					<p>A couple of years ago there were pretty good teachers but due to some unknown reasons the staff keeps changing. But now the teachers are Ph.D graduate and experianced.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Here comes the best part about Rizvi College of Engineering. You can come and go any time you want to, you are your own "marzi ka malik". Some teachers do threaten about attendance but that is just a formality. Years pass on and attendance keeps on falling. It's no big deal in Rizvi rather it turns out to be a plus point for students who want to study on their own. You can just come for practicals and study at home for the remaining time. So many students score out here. Imagine going to college right from 9am to 5pm and then rest of the evening being spent completing assignments. You can't even think of studying under such circumstances. Life is simple at Rizvi.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowd at Rizvi College of Engineering is predominantly Muslim due to the 50% quota. Overall, the crowd is pretty cool and the fact that Engineering college has Law, Science, Commerce, Arts, Architecture and Management colleges attached to it; means that you might get a chance to mingle with some of the best looking ones (if not engineering) in the locality (the canteen is common for all).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The Rizvi College of Engineering canteen is a paradise for non - veggies. It's really big; &nbsp;hence&nbsp;airy, well ventilated&nbsp;and mostly very crowded. You can get some of the tastiest food here. The prices won't be heavy on your pocket and yes, no one brings TIFFIN in Rizvi, so good is the canteen. The seating is very comfortable. Food available varies from Chaat to Chinese, traditional thalis and what not. Don’t forget to try the Bhurji-pav here.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">As Rizvi College of Engineering is located in Bandra there are myriad places to go out to. CCD, Barista, Sheeshas, Candies are the closest to the college, less than a minute away. You can reach hill road or linking road in minimum auto fare&nbsp; to find famous hangouts like Yokos, KFC, McDonalds, Falafels, American Bakery, J.Hearshe, Mumbai Times Cafe, Hukkah n Tikkah and many more. There are dozens of Frankie, sandwich and dosa stalls just outside the college at the cheapest rates. Many LAN gaming centres have also turned up here and have become a big <em>adda</em> for the bunkers. Also the famous <em>Tambe Gully</em> for those who like to smoke and dope.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">RAYS is the annual sports, cultural as well as technical fest of Rizvi College of Engineering</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Each year more than 30 % to 40 % students are placed through this cell. The training and placement cell is active to keep touch with the industry and invites them to come and visit the institute for campus interviews. Mechanical and Civil departments get the best placements. But, there is no guarantee of placements.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rizvi is a decent college for those score just about average marks in the entrance exam. Not too far from south Mumbai and easily accessible from western suburbs; so travelling is not an issue. A college in which you can spend 4 years with peace and without any interference from the college management unless you end up doing something really crazy. Students claim that teachers are less bothered about students and normally follow a very easy evaluation method, just fill the papers and you pass (not literally though). But there are disadvantages to it as well, so enter at your own risk!!</p>	</section>
