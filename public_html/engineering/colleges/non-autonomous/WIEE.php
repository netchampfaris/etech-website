					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology, Worli</h2>
					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology is located at Worli, a posh locality in south Mumbai. It has an incredible location on the Worli seaface, with its imposing structure towering over the Arabian Sea. It can reached by BEST buses which are available from all parts of the city. Closest railway station is Lower Parel (W.Rly.) about 10-15 minutes by taxi.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology functions from a single eight-storey building, which underwent renovation sometime back and plans are afoot to add another two floors to the building for additional laboratories and other facilities. The college has no open grounds. However, it does have other sporting facilities for playing table tennis, football, cricket, chess and carrom.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 1,15,763/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty at Watumull is a mixture. Some are good and experienced while there are a few who are ordinary too. The computers faculty is nice, but it is a bit strict. The biomedical faculty is like a school faculty. The faculty of the instrumentation branch is Ok. One faculty worth mentioning is of the EXTC branch. The EXTC has very good professors.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is quite strict. Attendance is verified orally even after signing so giving proxies is difficult...sickening!! Some professors don’t allow you to attend practicals if you don’t attend their lectures. If your attendance is really low they just send a letter at home and call parents. It actually varies from professor to professor and also on their mood. If you have a bad image, some professors like to trouble you during submissions.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd rocks. It is quite nice. Everyone is down to earth and quite co-operative and fun-loving. Well, there are a few exceptions, but those are obviously there everywhere. If you are lucky enough you will get good company. There are some groups who come from the same junior college, so getting into those could be difficult. Overall, you will have four pretty pleasant years. Also, the college has plenty of special days every now and then. Traditional, rose, chocolate, stripes, and many more. Life is enjoyable.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen at Watumull is very nice. The food is very tasty and cheap too. The canteen is not very spacious, so as to accommodate all the students during the lunch break, but students somehow manage. The canteen is a good place for people who like to dig into chinese food.<br> A special mention : Triple schezwan rice made by Shiva!!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Worli Seaface, Mafco, Atria mall and various other restaurants around. “Mela” serves good food but is a bit expensive. Spices and Flavours is another good option. Phoenix mills is a fantastic option, but it is a little far. There is great roll/frankly point right outside the main gate, which is very famous, you might want to try that out too.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Watumull College holds an annual festival, ENSEMBLE, which highlights the achievements of the college and its students. It is generally held after the conclusion of the first term of the year. It consists of events like rappelling, wall-climbing, robotics, a virtual stock exchange, mock detective games, treasure hunts, base games, crystal mazes and various personality contests.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Another College Fest held by Watumull is WIFI. It is a popular intercollegiate fest and is conducted every year around September. But the festival lets the college down as no technical events happen, but people attend just to play football.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 70% students are placed every year out of a total of 210 students. However, the placements are in good companies like L&amp;T, CapGemini, Tech Mahindra, Geodesic etc. with decent salaries (Average salary: Rs. 2.5 lac p.a.)</p>
