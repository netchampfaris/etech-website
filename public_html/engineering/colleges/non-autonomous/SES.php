					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Saraswati Education Society’s Group of Institutions Faculty of Engineering, Diksal</h2>
					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Saraswati Education Society’s Group of Institutions Faculty of Engineering is located very close to Bhivpuri Railway Stn (CST-Karjat route, Central Rly). It is mere 8-10 minute walk or rather climb (Its up the hill). So no problems in terms of accessibility once you manage to reach Bhivpuri station (which in itself is a feat)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college is newly established and the infrastructure is still under construction. However, the required equipment are available and practicals are not hampered. Library also well-stocked with required books. The campus is huge but lacks proper playground.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 60,000/- per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Moderate faculty with a dominance of junior professors, which is the case in most new colleges. Only the HoD’s are well learned, knowledgeable and experienced. Good part about faculty is that they are all friendly &amp; co-operative.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Saraswati Education Society’s Group of Institutions Faculty of Engineering is not all that strict in terms of attendance. Although they initially insist for 75% but relax it to&nbsp;50% later on. Below which parents are called for if the requirement is not met with. The term work marks also get affected due to a lack of attendance.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Majority is from central suburbs of Mumbai-city and everyone wears the attitude of “Work while you work and play while you play.”</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s a waterfall nearby, but that’s about it. The railway station is really close so you can head home straight-away. Other options include trekking or a trip to the nearby weekend get-away, Matheran.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen is yet to make its presence felt among the students. The quality of food keeps most of the students away. Even if they do happen to step into the premises occasionally (to eat Chinese food which is somewhat edible) there is no place to sit due to a lack of seating arrangement.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The first batch is yet to come out and nothing can be said till then.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">“Not that great, but will certainly improve as time goes by” says one student.</p>	</section>
