					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Smt. Indira Gandhi College of Engineering (SIGCE), Koparkhairane</h2>
					<hr>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">Smt. Indira Gandhi College of Engineering (SIGCE) is a 15 minute walk from Kopar Khairane railway station which falls on the Thane-Vashi/Nerul route. Although there seem to be a few buses which go to this college from the station, it's best not wait for them. If you have company from the railway station it is advisable to take an autorickshaw as it only comes to around 15-20 bucks.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>

Only if the attendance is pathetically poor, parents are summoned and a warning is given at the most.

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Not many places around the college to go &amp; have a good time. Just a few restaurants on the highway or else, if you are willing to go a little further, there is Vashi.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Not recommended for anyone travelling too far as it won't be worth it. However, for below average scorers &amp; low scoring students staying in Thane or Navi Mumbai, it isn't bad option to settle for either. "You get in here, obtain your degree without much interference from the college and get going", that's what a student has to say.</p>	</section>
