					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dilkap Research Institute of Engineering &amp; Management Studies (DRIEMS), Neral</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">“Reaching Dilkap College during peak hours could someday be given as a ‘Roadies’ Task”, says a student. Dilkap Research Institute of Engineering &amp; Management Studies (DRIEMS) is located at the foot of&nbsp;heavenly&nbsp;mountains of Matheran, Neral. It is 1 km from Neral railway station; you can get there by&nbsp;rickshaw (5-10 mins)&nbsp;or by a 25 minute trek. Getting a rick is a good option but a walk is not heavy when you have beautiful views in front of you.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Dilkap Research Institute of Engineering &amp; Management Studies (DRIEMS)&nbsp;has a really good infrastructure built in roman style of architecture. Campus is huge including almost all academic facilities such as library, workshops, labs, gym, ground, canteen etc. Labs and workshops are well&nbsp;equipped. And the place is under development, a new construction shows up every year.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs 83294/-per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">"Nothing exceptional, but tolerable enough", comments a student and is quickly agreed upon by some others.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">75% attendance is compulsory and the&nbsp;college&nbsp;is strict about it. However they are considerate and give relaxation in attendance for genuine reasons. Measures are taken to make students attend, such as a fine of Rs 100 per day is collected or parents are called or students are burdened with extra assignments. But no serious action is usually taken against till you have 40%.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Crowd at&nbsp;Dilkap College is fine. Students from all over&nbsp;Mumbai&nbsp;come here but majority are from suburbs on central railway line. The crowd is not happening &amp; those coming from western suburbs might have a tough time gelling with others. But after a while one can find a few like-minded students and then the college life becomes enjoyable.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Canteen is fab. It’s just like a good local restaurant in your budget. There’s a great variety and you’ll get virtually everything that you can think of, may it be&nbsp;Chinese, South Indian, North&nbsp;Indian or junk food.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">College itself is a great hangout in Neral. In Monsoon the college is a dream hangout for nature lovers. One can have an amazing view of the surrounding fields, mountains &amp; waterfalls from the terrace, that’s only if they can manage to sneak in because entry to terrace is restricted. It’s like you are going to a weekend retreat. Not to forget Matheran is also not too far.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festival:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Dilkap Research Institute of Engineering &amp; Management Studies&nbsp;hosts its cultural festival ‘Zealous’ during months February - March and technical fest in March. Zealous is quite happening compared to festivals of other colleges in this area. Being a new college, students have great liberty to try out innovative things during the festival but also expectations are high and students working hard to meet those expectations.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placement:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rumour&nbsp;has it that DRIEMS is going to have great placements in Indian &amp; multinational companies. However as the first batch is still yet to come out it’s too early to comment anything about them. Students can only hope for the ‘rumours’ to come true.</p>
