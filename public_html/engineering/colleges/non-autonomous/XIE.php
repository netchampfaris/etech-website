					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Xavier Institute of Engineering, Mahim</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Xavier Institute of Engineering is 15 minutes by foot from Mahim railway station (W. Rly. And Harbour Rly.) However, the roads are very dusty and there is a traffic jam always so it is very irritating to walk. But with no other option, one has &nbsp;to suffer everyday while coming from and going to college. The other option is to come by bus, again a 15 minute walk on foot from Mahim bus depot. A few buses do drop you right in front of the college but their frequency really sucks.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure Xavier Institute of Engineering is not very satisfactory. The college ground is big enough to play all sports. Majority of the lab equipments work properly. Classooms are in decent conditon. Libraries have desired number of books. Lack of lush green plantations is a big thumbs down to such a huge campus.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 95,000/- year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the teachers at Xavier Instiute of Engineering (XIE) are good but there are a few horrible exceptions. The fresh graduates who have taken up teaching are really pathetic. The best faculty is in EXTC and IT departments.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The principal has started the system of sending letters at home and threatens to detain students who bunk regularly. As long as you keep it above 70% there should be no problems.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many Christians because of&nbsp; the Christian quota at Xavier Engineering College. Overall the crowd is good and you won’t realize where time went by. &nbsp;Four years of engineering can be easily dealt with.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen is small and there is too less variety of food to offer. XAVIER’s MANAGEMENT, if you ever happen to read this, please do something about it. The prices are economical though.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Only one word, “Bandra”. There is nothing much in Mahim so the students usually head to Bandra which is nearby.&nbsp;Innumerable places to go once you reach Bandra.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The cultural festival of Xavier Institute of Engineering is “Spandan” and the technical festival is “Transmission”. They are usually held in February in alternate years. So, effectively only one festival to have fun every year. SIGH!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">60% of the students get placed. Tech Mahindra takes maximum students. Patni, Infosys, Accenture and Quinox are the other major companies.&nbsp;The placements and salaries offered are just about average. It is said that Panasonic recruited a student from EXTC and offered 12 lakh p.a.. Hope it's true.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Contact Address:</h3>
					<address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Xavier Institute of Engineering,</span></address><address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Opposite S.L.Raheja Hospital,</span></address><address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Mahim Causeway, Mahim (West),</span></address><address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Mumbai - 400016.</span></address><address style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Website: <a href="http://www.xavierengg.com/" target="_blank">www.xavierengg.com</a></span></address>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Xavier Engineering College is definitely not your first choice but it is a better option than the colleges which are far away from Mumbai if you don’t manage to get into the top colleges.</p>	</section>
