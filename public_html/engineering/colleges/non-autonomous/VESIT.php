					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology (VESIT), Chembur</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Nearest station from Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology (VESIT) fondly known as “Swami”, is Kurla (C. Rly. &amp; Harbour Rly.) about 1-2 km from college. So, assuming you get a rick immediately, you should reach the college within 10 minutes. The new campus is located in Collectors Colony, Chembur.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college has recently moved into the new campus and the infrastructure is pretty awesome now. Each department has different floors with huge and well-equipped labs. New and efficient PCs have been brought in and the students seem to be very happy with the performance of the super-fast computers.<br> The only downside of the new campus is the pungent smell which is perennial throughtout the day. After a few days students do get used to it.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.E Fee: Rs. 1,11,813y-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.E Fee: Rs. 1,13,468/-year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Placements:</h3>
					<p>Great records at VESIT. 100 % placement in top IT companies. Microsoft picks up 4-5 students sometimes. Average salaries is a good Rs. 3 lac/year with maximum salary even going upto Rs. 8.5 lac/year. For academic year 2011, multinational companies like Deloitte, JP Morgan and Nomura picked up around 20 students each. Microsoft took around 10, Morgan Stanley - 2 and GE - 10. And companies like BPCL, HPCL and Honeywell also visit the campus.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s not much to say about the faculty of Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology (VESIT) as its just the same like any other engineering college, some professors are excellent and the remaining are just about average.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is strict. It’s not a problem for majority of the people at VESIT because if you have 65 % attendance (which most of people here manage)&nbsp; there are absolutely no issues, below which they generally call your parents for a small visit. Some students are detained, very rarely though. But at the same time your term-work is screwed equally. “But not at all as strict as its known to be!”, says one of their student (you also get some idea about the crowd from his statement).</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the crowd looks a lot more refreshing as compared to engineering standards, it's certainly nerdy. People are more inclined towards studies which ultimately does pay them off, because they get excellent results. Bunking and hanging out is usually avoided because it's difficult to find those kind of students here. There's a minority quota for Sindhis. Eventhough located on the Harbour/Central line, students from various other parts of the city join this is reputed institute.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the time the college has moved to the new campus, the canteen at VESIT seems to be pretty much appealing in terms of ambience and food. A lot of variety in food is available and at extremely low prices. So its quite light on the pocket, and you wouldn’t really mind the ambience after that. Oh, and there are three canteens. *Huge Smile*</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">McDonald’s is nearby which is the favourite among the students, Barista, CCD, Dominos, Ambrosia, Baskin Robins, Acres Club, Cream Centre are among other options available next to Swami</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are events all round the year at Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology (VESIT) from robotics to debates. There are three societies which conduct such events after college hours. Receives good participation.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">College has one techfest called Praxis, one cultural fest Utsav, and Sports Fest Sphurti, which also receive amazing response from the students.</p>
