					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Juhu</h2>
					<hr>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #4f8335;"><em><strong>Note: The admission process for DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering is conducted outside of CAP and more information related to the admission process can be found <a href="/engineering-admissions?id=110">here</a>.</strong></em></span></p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering (DJSCoE) fondly known as DJ Sanghvi or just "DJ" is in J.V.P.D scheme, opposite the very famous Cooper Hospital along with the cluster of several reputed SVKM institutes. It takes about 10 minutes by rickshaw from Vile Parle railway station (W. Rly. &amp; Harbour Rly.)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">"<em>Yeh to five star hotel ki tarah hai yaar</em>" that is what you hear when people see DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering for the first time. The infrastructure is one of the best in town. The canteen does not have the best ambience but as the saying goes "don't judge the book by its cover". As soon as you reach the first floor, you are awestruck by its magnificence and don't miss the washrooms! The college has an advanced infrastructure which includes a wi-fi equipped library, air-conditioned classrooms, a gymnasium, gymkhana and a conference room. Waiting for the elevators can be a bit irritating; so during the wee hours most prefer to climb the stairs. Laboratories are maintained upto the mark; atleast as compared to the rest of the engineering colleges in the city. The college lacks a campus and in-hostel facility. However&nbsp;there is a hostel in and a few students stay there.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">B.E Fee: Rs. 1,15,161/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">M.E Fee: Rs. 1.12L per year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Placements:</h3>
					<p>DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering has a phenomenal placement record, you won't be jobless for sure! Big names come to pick you up after graduation. NO worries about that! TCS &amp; Accenture pick the maximum number of students with L&amp;T and Patni Computers following at hand. Placements MAY sometimes be a matter of concern for Biomed and Chemical students though, because a few of them sometimes don't clear the minimum criteria for ANY company. That isn't the college's fault, though.</p>
					<p>Other major companies visiting the campus: JP Morgan, AMDOCS, Godrej, Microsoft, Capgemini, Ernst and Young, Morgan Stanley. Average salary is around 5 LPA and highest went to 33 LPA for 2013 batch.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Its one of the best at DJ Sanghvi, at least in the first year; you will realize it if you attend. The other years have good professors for one or two out of six or seven subjects while the others are average. You might meet a couple of nagging professors but the rapport with the students is pretty good. Students find the teachers friendly and helpful.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is moderately strict in DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering. 75% is recommended and students are given assignments and university papers to solve if the requirement is not met with.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">You will actually find the cream crowd of engineering at DJ Sanghvi with an exciting blend of fashion, money and brains! Life at DJ is pretty cool. You meet all sorts of people and always end up with folks you like. Lots of Gujjus around because of the 50% Gujurati quota, but that's quite a good thing, actually. Students are ambitious, competitive and participate over enthusiatically in the festivals which mind you, is not extraordinary. The crowd hails from Northern - Western Mumbai to South Mumbai and some from the Central and Harbour belt as well.&nbsp;</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen’s look is not that great but the food is quite good &amp; cheap. For those whose taste buds are accustomed to Chinese cuisine, this place is heaven. However, lack of seating facility doesn’t make the experience a good one, especially if you enter the canteen around the peak time. There’s little space to move and the temperature has nearly doubled!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Papillon Restaurant (You will find most of the college here), Amar, NM Canteen, the very famous street side vada pavs, dosas and everything you want, Cooper canteen (if you have the guts!). And you are under a Gujju Mandal so food is not a problem at all. And Juhu beach is like the <em>be-saharon ka sahara</em>. Other eat-outs include Pizza Hut, Crepe station, Garcia’s, Subway, Khaasiyat, McDonald’s, ShivSagar, Naturals (The ice-cream of Juhu scheme). And if you still feel the list is still incomplete then most DJites are seen hogging mouthwatering delicious food items at its sister institute, Mukesh Patel's canteen.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Following festivals are celebrated at DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering:</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Parichay (Cultural Festival), Pulse (Technical Festival) &amp; Iridescence (Sports Festival)</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
