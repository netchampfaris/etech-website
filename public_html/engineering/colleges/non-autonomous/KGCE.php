					<h2>Konkan Gyanpeeth College of Engineering (KGCE), Karjat</h2>
					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location :</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Konkan Gyanpeeth College of Engineering (KGCE) is located in Dahivali Karjat, a distant suburb of Mumbai and a favourite destination among the trekkers. It takes about 2 hrs of train travelling from Dadar to reach Karjat Railway Stn. If that’s not enough, the college is also pretty far from the station (about 3 kms) and you have to take a rick from the stn to reach the college. This will cost anything between Rs. 8 to Rs. 40 depending on the number of people you are comfortable travelling with. College bus facility is also available with a nominal Rs. 150/month.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college building is fairly new and is just about nearing completion with a little interior work remaining here and there. Classrooms are decent and there is internet facility in the air-conditioned labs. However, the IT students complain of not having a separate section in the building for their department. There is a playground for recreation and a hostel only for the first years.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 60,500/ year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Decent faculty with a good proportion of senior professors, who are knowledgeable and experienced. The EXTC department boasts of the best faculty in the college. However, some students from the Comps &amp; IT department complain that the some professors supposedly do not come to lectures regularly and the syllabus remains uncovered.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is not much of an issue at Konkan Gyanpeeth College of Engineering. Students with upto 50% attendance are spared with no action taken at all. Below 50% the students are fined Rs. 500/- or their parents are called.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Enthusiastic and always excited to participate in sports and co-curricular activities. Most of the students hail from the Central railway from areas like Kalyan, Dombivali &amp; Thane.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A trek to the nearby hills is the first thing that comes to the mind of the students. There is nothing very close to the college, but a 10-15 minute walk and you can have one of the best Wada Pav in the state at “Thakre’s”. Datta Trey is absolutely recommended for Non-vegeterians.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Good and edible food. The canteen is spacious and the best varieties recommended by students are Bhurji Pav, Chicken cutlet, aloo&nbsp; tikkis and veg pattis. The&nbsp; prices are moderate.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Konkan Gyanpeeth College of Engineering celebrates its technical festival Hypercube in February-end and the cultural-cum-sports festival Spring Fiesta in the 1<sup>st</sup> week of March. Also dassera is celebrated. There’s freshers party for the new comers and a farewell party for the final years. Alumni functions are also held round the year.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Konkan Gyanpeeth College of Engineering doesn’t have good record for placements. The best placements are for Mechanical and EXTC (about 25% of the students are placed). The other faculties are lagging behind at mere 10% placements. Major recruiters are Infosys and Wipro.</p>
