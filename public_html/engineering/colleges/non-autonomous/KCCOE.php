					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">KC College of Engineering (KCCOE), Thane</h2>
					<hr style="text-align: justify;">
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Location:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">KC College of Engineering is located in Thane east in a place is called Kopri. It is about 10 minutes walking distance from the station.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The infrastructure at KC College has improved significantly over the past 2 years. The classrooms and labs have been renovated. Every classroom now has a projector. The labs in the college are well equipped with ALOT of computing machines. The ground is small but guys still manage to play. The library, though not visited by students, is amazing. Many students are now pretty happy with the infrastructure.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fees:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Rs. 125000/year</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Faculty:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The faculty at KC College of Engineering is very mixed. The old staff is adamant in their old ways and not very cooperative. A few new professors have very sound technical skills and even teach well. But over all a student has to go through some amount of trouble to get things done in his/her way.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The non teaching staff are just not interested in working.” Most students, though, think its all part of the disaster called engineering and just get on with life.</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attendance:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance is a bit strict at KC College of Engineering. They generally expect you to keep your attendance above 75%. If your attendance is very low then your parents are called, little drama is said to be done and soon its forgotten. But impression is very important in this college. So attending the lectures is good for the students although they are cited as useless.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crowd:<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The crowd at KC College of Engineering is not as good as you’d expect but tolerable. Majority of students are lethargic and least interested in extracurricular activities and only a few select groups of people are actively involved in all the activities.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Only if you are terribly lucky will you find good company for yourself.</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Canteen:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The canteen in the college is not something that’s constant. The canteen staff keeps changing periodically almost every semester and so does the type of food. That’s mainly because not many students visit the canteen often enough to keep it running.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hangouts:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The college is at the dead end of Thane. A couple of local eateries and coffee shops keep the students fed. Most of the college crowd chooses to go to McDonalds in Thane west. You can also find most of the crowd in Korum Mall which is considerably far from the college.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Festivals:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">KC College of Engineering hosts two festivals annually. “Reflexionz” is their annual cultural festival and has grown considerably over the years. The college Rock festival “Autumn” is a highlight of this event. There is also a technical festival by the name of “Detroix”, the students work very hard at this event and this is one event that is of a good standard.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Placements:</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The placement record at KC College of Engineering is pretty good. Mass recruiters like Accenture, TCS and Infosys visit the campus and pick up the cream students. Big MNC's and exorbitant salary payers are never seen here, though students to get an opportunity to attend their drives in various pool campuses. Roughly, 50 to 60% of the students get placed if they manage to clear the basic criteria of the company. Average pay package would be anything close to 2.5L.</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Verdict:</h3>
					<p>An average and upcoming college which is a good place to go if you’re really interested in engineering but lack a little in your academics. The college provides a good platform for such students to come up in the world. This place is getting better slowly and maybe will be in line with mid-size colleges in the future.</p>	</section>
